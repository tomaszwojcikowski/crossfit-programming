- Athlete ready for Set 1 @ 67%

**Coach’s Cues**
- “Fight for the elbows” — keep the elbows high as fatigue sets in
- “Chest up, elbows up” — maintain upright torso throughout the set
- Prioritize the front-rack stretch if athletes feel tightness

A) STRENGTH — FRONT SQUAT

Every 2 minutes for 7 sets

| Sets | Reps | Load |
|---:|---:|---:|
| Sets 1–3 | 8 | 67% |
| Set 4 | 5 | 72% |
| Sets 5–6 | 2 | 77% |
| Set 7 | 1 | 82% |

**Coach’s Note:** Remind athletes to “fight for the elbows.” As sets get heavier and fatigue accumulates the torso will want to lean — cue: “chest up, elbows up.”

B) CONDITIONING — BARBELL COMPLEX

Every 2 minutes for 7 sets

5 Deadlifts (60/35 kg)

4 Hang Cleans

3 Front Squats

2 Push Press

1 Jerk

**Strategy:** This is a technical sprint. Perform the complex UNBROKEN. If an athlete drops the bar, they restart the set.

Sets 1-3: 8 Reps @ 67%

Set 4: 5 Reps @ 72%

Sets 5-6: 2 Reps @ 77%

Set 7: 1 Rep @ 82%

Coach's Note: Remind athletes to "fight for the elbows." As the sets get heavier and fatigue sets in, the torso will want to lean; the cue is "chest up, elbows up."

B) CONDITIONING: BARBELL COMPLEX

Every 2 Minutes for 7 Sets

5 Deadlifts (60/35kg)

4 Hang Cleans
