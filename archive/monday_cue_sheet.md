## Session Notes & Timers (for coaches)
- Strength: Every 2:00 for 7 sets — start clock; athlete lifts on the minute every 2 minutes.
- Conditioning: Every 2:00 for 7 sets — athletes perform the barbell complex UNBROKEN; rest until next 2-minute start.

Coach pacing tips:
- Use the 30–60s rest between rounds/build sets for quick cues and adjustments.
- Keep demonstrations under 20s; show one clean demo and cue the group.
- If an athlete needs extra front-rack mobility, give them the 30s per side in Mobility and skip one low-intensity prep repetition.

## One-line Cues (readable quickly)
- Front squat: "Fight for the elbows. Chest up, elbows up."
- Deadlift: "Bar close, lats tight, hip hinge."
- Hang clean: "Elbow fast, catch soft."
- Push press/jerk: "Small dip — violent drive — fast feet."
- Complex strategy: "Smooth and unbroken. If you drop the bar, restart."

---

## Quick Checklist before Set 1
- Athlete warmed (light sweat)
- Front rack mobility checked (elbows not rounded)
- Build sets completed and athlete confident at 67%
- Empty-bar complex performed successfully
