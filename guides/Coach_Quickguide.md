# Coach Quickguide — 60 Minute CrossFit Class

Purpose: concise checklist and scripts for running a safe, efficient, high-quality class.

## 1) Whiteboard Brief (0:00–0:03)
- Stimulus: 1 sentence — what energy system or skill we're training.
- Flow: equipment layout and transitions (single group start).
- Scaling: A/B/C clear options and substitutions.
- Safety note: any high-risk cues or injuries to avoid.

Example: "This is a glycolytic sprint — keep sets < 10s. Rowers left, bars right.
Scale: Thrusters 95/65/45. If shoulder pain, do goblet squats."

## 2) Warm-up (0:03–0:12) — RAMP (8–10 min)
- Raise: 2–3 min easy cardio (row/bike/rope).
- Activate: movement-specific drills 3–5 min (band pull-aparts, glute bridges).
- Mobilize: short 60–90s positional holds (ankle, T-spine, hips).
- Potentiate: 2 sets of movement primer (light bar, 3–5 power reps).

Coach notes: keep cues short; scan while athletes move.

### Warm-up drill examples
- Row-focused (machines available): 500m easy, 2 × 10 ABS hollow rocks, 2 × 8 empty-bar hang power cleans.
- Gymnastics-focused: 90s jump rope, 2 × 8 scap pulls, 3 × 5 banded pull-ups (activation).
- Weightlifting-focused: 3 × 5 PVC or empty bar tall cleans, 2 × 3 power cleans at 50–60% of working weight.

## 3) Skill / Strength Block (0:12–0:25)
- Teach: Tell (≤10s), Show, Do (athlete attempts), Check (1–3 reps each athlete).
- Use micro/macro scan: 1-1-1 cadence (see one, correct one, scan room).
- Triage: Safety → Function (power leaks) → Optimization.

PAPE quick rule: if using heavy singles/doubles for potentiation, plan **3–7 min** rest
before power task; use mobility or low-intensity prep in that window.

### Sample progressions (2–6 min each)
- Clean progression: PVC high-pull → empty-bar hang clean x3 → power clean x2 (light) → 2 working singles.
- HSPU progression: scap activation → incline push-ups → deficit push-ups → 1–2 handstand holds → attempts with spot.

Coach tip: for mixed-ability groups, run progressions in stations so athletes self-select intensity.

## 4) Build-Up & Logistics (0:25–0:35)
- Allow athletes to build to working weight with individual scaling guidance.
- Check 1–2 reps at heavier loads for setup and safety.

Build-up checklist:
- Warm sets: 2 sets with increasing load, last set 2–3 reps at ~75% for technical check (advanced athletes).
- Advanced lifters: cue bar path and hip extension; novices: focus on consistent mechanics across reps.

## 5) WOD Execution (0:35–0:50)
- Role: scan, motivate, triage faults, enforce standards under fatigue.
- Cue style: short external cues (e.g., "Push the ground away", "Land soft").
- Equipment bottlenecks: keep a single start by scaling the plan (share stations,
  reduce reps, or use bodyweight cardio substitutes).

Common in-WOD interventions:
- Safety stop: call a clear stop phrase and instruct reset ("Stop, reset hips, then continue").
- Minimal cue: single word prompts at micro-breaks ("Breathe", "Tight").

Transition management:
- If athletes bunch at one station, call alternating rotations (e.g., 10s swap) to reduce collisions.

## 6) Cooldown & Debrief (0:50–1:00)
- 2–4 min aerobic cooldown + 2 mobility positions (45–60s each).
- Debrief: 2–4 min structured close (see below).

### Debrief (2–4 min) — what to include

Goal: downshift the room, capture learning, and keep people coming back.

1) Physiology downshift (20–40s)
- "Slow nasal breaths. Hands on ribs. Heart rate down."

2) Bright Spots (60–90s)
- Ask: "One bright spot from today?" (effort, pacing, mechanics, mindset).
- Reinforce scaling: "Smart scaling is strong training."

3) Score + stimulus check (30–60s)
- Ask for time/rounds/loads.
- Confirm stimulus hit: sprint vs grind, continuous vs broken.
- If not: name the fix for next time (lighter load, smaller sets, simpler movement).

4) One technical takeaway (20–40s)
- Pick ONE theme for the whole class (e.g., "fast elbows", "brace then move").
- Optional: call out 1–2 specific wins (no public shaming).

5) Next-step guidance (20–40s)
- "Tomorrow is [engine/skill]. Show up and build the habit."
- Give one small homework option: 5 min walk + couch stretch.

6) Logistics (10–20s)
- Remind: log score, hydrate, upcoming schedule/announcements.

Mini mobility micro-protocol (3–6 min total):
- 90s per side banded ankle dorsiflexion or calf mobilization.
- 90s couch stretch (quads/hip flexor) each side or 60s per side alternating.
- 60s T-spine foam roll + 2 × wall slides.

## Quick Cueing Cheatsheet (use external focus)
- Squat: "Spread the floor with your feet."
- Deadlift: "Paint your legs with the bar."
- Clean: "Jump the bar to the ceiling."
- Press/Jerk: "Throw the bar through the roof."
- Box Jump: "Land like a cat."

Additional one-word cues for in-WOD use:
- "Breathe" — regain control on monostructural pieces.
- "Explode" — power emphasis after heavy or PAPE work.
- "Soft" — landing quality on jumps.

## Scanning & Correction Workflow
- Macro scan continuously; switch to micro for 1–3 reps to correct.
- Use Sandwich method: Praise → Fix → Praise.
- Use verbal + visual + tactile selectively (ask permission for touch).

Correction examples:
- Early arm pull in clean: "Jump the bar" (external) + demonstrate vertical intent.
- Knee valgus on squat: "Spread the floor" + place hand at knee to cue outward push.

## Scaling Principles (preserve stimulus)
- Load: reduce % of 1RM to allow intended rep rhythm.
- Volume: reduce reps to keep time domain (e.g., 21→15→9).
- Complexity: substitute biomechanically similar simpler movements.

Scaling examples:
- Thrusters 95/65/45 → Push Press (same bar path) → KB thruster (lighter)
- Pull-ups → Jumping pull-ups → Band-assisted → Ring rows
- Double-unders → Single-unders × 2 or 30s double-under practice between rounds
- Box jump 24/20/16" → Step-ups or lower box height → 2×Box touch + jump on heavy days

## Safety Checklist (before starting)
- Equipment staged and paths clear.
- Athletes aware of scaling options.
- First-timers identified and supervised.

Emergency & spotting quick rules:
- If an athlete drops a loaded bar on chest/neck, shout "Set bar" and call for help.
- Spotting cleans/jerks: hands-free cueing; only physically assist when athlete requests or imminent failure occurs.
- Keep a first-aid kit visible and staff CPR-certified.

## 1-line Scripts (copyable)
- Start brief: "Stimulus: sprint. If you're resting >10s, lighten the load."
- Cue for full class: "Breathe down the nose on the row. Stay tall on the squat."
- Correction: "Bigger jump, softer landing — try one now."

More scripts:
- Mid-WOD check: "If your form breaks, slow your sets — keep moving."
- Pacing reminder: "Aim for even splits — negative splits win races."
- Encouragement: "Two more good reps — that's the set you want to remember."

Debrief scripts:
- "Quick debrief: breathe, then one bright spot each."
- "Did we hit the stimulus? What would you change next time?"
- "One cue to keep: _____. Take that with you."
