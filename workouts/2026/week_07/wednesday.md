# WEDNESDAY: Team KB Conditioning + Synchro Push-ups

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Machine (Row/Bike/Ski OR Shuttles), Kettlebells (16/12 kg), Floor space for push-ups
*   **Stimulus:** Team of 2, high-rep KB volume + shoulder endurance. Constant movement.
*   **Standards:** KB lockout overhead (snatch/lunges). Hip crease below knee (goblet squat). Chest/hips touch floor, elbows lock out (push-up).
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** 16/12 kg KB + strict synchro push-ups (High load, partner coordination)
    *   **B:** 12/8 kg KB + scaled push-ups (hands elevated) (Reduced load, maintain volume)
    *   **C:** 8/6 kg KB + push-ups from knees (Load/complexity reduced)
*   **Top Cues:** "Punch the KB to the ceiling." "Hips drive the squat." "Push the floor away."
*   **Bottleneck:** KB availability + space for synchro push-ups. Stage 2 KBs per pair + clear floor space.

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: High-rep KB snatches/squats/lunges + push-ups. Prime shoulders, hips, and trunk.*

*Equipment: Machine OR shuttle run area, Kettlebell (light), Floor space*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 10 shuttle runs + 10 KB deadlifts (light) + 8 Push-ups (slow, quality)
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** KB walking lunges + 8 KB goblet squats (light) + 6 KB swings (light) + 6 Push-ups (moderate speed)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** KB explosive lunges + 5 KB snatches/arm (light) + 5 Explosive push-ups (clap or fast)
*   *Rest:* 30-60s between rounds.

*Machine Sub: If no machines, use shuttle runs (10m out/back) OR high knees (2x time).*

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Open shoulders for KB overhead + hips for goblet squats and lunges.*

*   **Lat Stretch on Rig:** 30-40s/side. Grab rig upright, step back, sink hips, lean away from anchor. (Lat/shoulder mobility for KB snatches and overhead lunges)
*   **Couch Stretch:** 30-40s/side. Rear knee down, foot against wall/box, drive hips forward. (Hip flexor opening for reverse lunges and squat depth)

## Workout

**Prep (Movement Primer):**
*Practice KB transitions and synchro push-ups with partner. Establish rhythm.*

*   5 KB snatches/arm (working weight) + 5 Goblet squats (working KB)
*   5 OH reverse lunges/leg (working KB) + 10 Synchro push-ups with partner
*   *Test:* 10 KB snatches + 10 push-ups synchro. Check timing and communication.

*Total Time: 4:00*

**Conditioning: Team of 2, 25:00 AMRAP**
*Partners alternate work on KB movements. Both perform synchro push-ups after each exercise block.*

**Sequence (Repeat for max rounds):**
*   60 KB Snatches (Left arm only)
*   *→ 15 Synchro Push-ups (both athletes, together)*
*   60 Goblet Squats
*   *→ 15 Synchro Push-ups (both athletes, together)*
*   60 KB Snatches (Right arm only)
*   *→ 15 Synchro Push-ups (both athletes, together)*
*   60 Overhead Reverse Lunges (alternating legs)
*   *→ 15 Synchro Push-ups (both athletes, together)*

*Work Split: Partners trade off in manageable chunks (e.g., 10-15 reps each). Communicate clearly.*

*Score: Total rounds + reps completed (score KB movements only, push-ups are "buy-in" after each block).*

*Target: 1.5-2 full rounds. Push-ups should take 20-30s each set (don't grind).*

## Cooldown (4-5 min)

**Protocol: Active Recovery + Upper Body Release**
*High-volume shoulders/hips = muscular fatigue + metabolic buildup.*

**1. Immediate Reset (60s)**
*   **Child's Pose:** 30-60s. Knees wide, hips back, arms extended. Breathe into shoulders.
    *Decompresses shoulders after high-rep overhead work.*
*   **Physiological Sighs:** 5-10 cycles. Double inhale (nose) → long exhale (mouth).
    *Calms nervous system after sustained effort.*

**2. Active Flush (3 min)**
*   Easy bike or row at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (caps intensity, promotes parasympathetic tone).
*   *Target: Clear lactate from shoulders/legs. Sub: easy walk.*

**3. Static Stretching (2 min)**
*Elevated muscle temperature optimal for tissue lengthening.*

*   **Thread the Needle:** 45s/side. Lying on side, thread arm under body, rotate shoulder.
    *Posterior shoulder/rotator cuff—worked hard in KB overhead positions.*
*   **Pigeon Pose:** 45s/side. Hips square, forward fold optional.
    *Deep hip rotators—glutes/hips fatigued from squats and lunges.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* 20s nasal, slow exhales.
*   *Bright spot:* "Clear communication with partner?" "Consistent push-up sets?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Lock out the KB overhead. Drive hips in squats."
*   *Logistics:* Log rounds + reps. Note partner and any scaling.

## Coach Notes

**Whiteboard Brief (≤3:00):**
1. **Stimulus:** Team volume grinder. Share KB work, synchro push-ups after each block.
2. **Flow:** Prep (4 min) → 25 min AMRAP. Partners need 2 KBs + clear floor space for push-ups.
3. **Scaling:** A = 16/12kg + strict push-ups | B = 12/8kg + elevated hands | C = 8/6kg + knee push-ups.
4. **Safety:** KB lockout overhead every rep. If shoulder pain, reduce load or skip snatches/lunges.

**During Workout:**
- Scan: KB lockout (elbow straight), squat depth (hip crease below knee), push-up quality (chest/hips touch).
- Cue: "Punch the KB to the ceiling." "Hips drive the squat up." (external focus)
- Triage: If push-ups break down → elevate hands on box or switch to knees.
- Pacing: Partners should trade every 10-15 reps. Push-ups should be 20-30s, not longer.

**Team Dynamics:**
- Equal work split: Watch for one partner dominating. Enforce equal trading.
- Synchro push-ups: Both partners' chests hit floor together. "3, 2, 1, go" cadence works well.
- Communication: Encourage clear hand signals or verbal cues for switches.

**Debrief Focus:**
- Teamwork win: "We communicated every switch clearly."
- Pacing win: "Push-ups stayed quick and unbroken."
- Movement win: "Locked out KB overhead every single rep."
