# THURSDAY: 8 Rounds Mixed Modal (Run/Walls/Devil/T2B)

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Machine (Row/Bike/Ski OR Run Route), Dumbbells (22.5/15 kg), Pull-up Rig, Wall space
*   **Stimulus:** Long grind, mixed modal. Aerobic engine + shoulder stamina + core.
*   **Standards:** 4 laps = specify distance (e.g., 100m). Chest/thighs touch wall, feet touch floor. DBs lockout overhead. Toes touch bar between hands (T2B).
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** Rx loads + strict T2B (High skill, preserve movements)
    *   **B:** 15/10 kg DBs + 6 devil press + strict hanging knee raises (Reduce load/volume)
    *   **C:** 10/7.5 kg DBs + DB burpee + press + strict knee raises (Complexity reduced)
*   **Top Cues:** "Launch up the wall." "Press DBs through the ceiling." "Kick toes to the bar."
*   **Bottleneck:** Wall space + rig space. Stagger starts if needed (heats).

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: Long endurance piece + shoulders/core. Prime aerobic system and shoulder stability.*

*Equipment: Machine OR run route, Dumbbells (light), Pull-up rig*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 2:00 easy machine/jog + 10 Inchworms (walk hands out, walk back) + 6 Scap pulls on rig
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 1:30 moderate machine/jog + 8 Wall taps (hands walk up wall, walk down) + 6 Active hangs (5s hold)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 1:00 hard machine/run + 5 DB push-ups (hands on DBs) + 5 Kip swings on rig
*   *Rest:* 30-60s between rounds.

*Machine Sub: If no machines/run route, use shuttle runs (10m out/back) OR high knees (2x time).*

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Open shoulders for wall walks/devil press + hip flexors for T2B.*

*   **Puppy Pose:** 45s. Knees on floor, hips over knees, chest drops toward floor, arms extended. (Shoulder flexion for overhead + wall walks)
*   **Couch Stretch:** 30s/side. Knee to wall, squeeze glute. (Hip flexor length for T2B kip)

## Workout

**Prep (Movement Primer):**
*Practice all four movements at working intensity. Check pacing and transitions.*

*   2 Wall walks (slow, focus on hand position)
*   5 Devil press (light DBs) → 3 Devil press (working weight)
*   5 Hanging knee raises → 5 T2B (or scaled version)
*   1 Lap run (moderate pace)
*   *Test:* 1 round at 80% effort. Check timing and bottlenecks.

*Total Time: 5:00*

**Conditioning: 8 Rounds For Time (Tc: 28:00)**
*Each round:*

*   4 Laps (Run - specify distance, e.g., 100m total = 25m/lap OR 200m total = 50m/lap)
*   4 Wall Walks
*   8 Devil Press (2x DB, 22.5/15 kg)
*   8 Toes-to-Bar

*Target Time: 18-25 minutes. Consistent round splits. Don't sprint early.*

*Score: Total time to complete 8 rounds. Mark scaling if used.*

*Note: Define "lap" distance clearly based on gym layout (e.g., "1 lap = around the building" or "4 laps = 200m total").*

## Cooldown (5-6 min)

**Protocol: Full-Body Recovery (Aerobic + Neural + Stretching)**
*Long mixed modal = systemic fatigue + shoulder/core overload.*

**1. Immediate Reset (60s)**
*   **Child's Pose:** 30-60s. Knees wide, hips back, arms extended. Breathe into shoulders and lower back.
    *Decompresses shoulders and spine after wall walks and devil press.*
*   **Physiological Sighs:** 5-10 cycles. Double inhale (nose) → long exhale (mouth).
    *Resets autonomic nervous system after sustained effort.*

**2. Active Flush (4 min)**
*   Easy walk or very slow jog at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (caps intensity, promotes recovery).
*   *Target: Clear metabolites, reduce muscle stiffness. Sub: easy bike/row.*

**3. Static Stretching (2-3 min)**
*Post-workout muscle temperature optimal for lengthening.*

*   **Puppy Pose:** 60s. Knees on floor, chest drops, arms extended.
    *Shoulders/lats—heavily loaded from wall walks and devil press overhead.*
*   **Pigeon Pose:** 45s/side. Hips square, forward fold optional.
    *Deep hip rotators—glutes worked from running and burpee bottom position.*
*   **Supine Figure-4:** 45s/side. Lying on back, ankle over knee, pull thigh toward chest.
    *Hip external rotators—secondary stretch for glutes.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* 20s nasal, slow exhales.
*   *Bright spot:* "Consistent round splits?" "Kept moving without stopping?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Launch up the wall. Press DBs through the ceiling."
*   *Logistics:* Log time and rounds. Note any scaling.

## Coach Notes

**Whiteboard Brief (≤3:00):**
1. **Stimulus:** Long aerobic grinder. 8 rounds = consistency over speed.
2. **Flow:** Prep (5 min) → 28 min cap. Clarify lap distance. Stage DBs near walls/rig.
3. **Scaling:** A = Rx + strict T2B | B = 15/10kg + 6 devil + knee raises | C = light DBs + burpee+press + knee raises.
4. **Safety:** Wall walks—don't collapse onto head. Devil press—lock out overhead. T2B—control the descent.

**During Workout:**
- Scan: Wall walk hand position (stable base), DB lockout (elbows straight), T2B quality (toes between hands).
- Cue: "Walk hands close to the wall." "Press the DBs through the ceiling." (external focus)
- Triage: If wall walks break down → reduce to 3 or wall taps. If T2B fails → switch to knee raises mid-workout.
- Pacing: Target 2.5-3 min/round. If under 2 min, too light. Over 4 min, scale volume or load.

**Round Management:**
- Lap distance: Clearly define before workout (e.g., "1 lap = 50m" or "around the building").
- Transitions: Encourage smooth movement between stations. No long rest between movements.
- Mental game: "Focus on this round only. Don't think about round 8 yet."

**Debrief Focus:**
- Endurance win: "Kept moving without long breaks."
- Pacing win: "Round times stayed consistent throughout."
- Tech win: "Wall walks stayed controlled even when tired."
