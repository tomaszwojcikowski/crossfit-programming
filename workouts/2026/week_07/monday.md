# MONDAY: Front Squats & Thruster/Pull-up Intervals

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Machine (Row/Bike/Ski OR Shuttles), Barbell, Pull-up Rig
*   **Stimulus:** Heavy front squat progression + high-power intervals (legs + pull).
*   **Standards:** Parallel depth on squats. Hip crease below knee. Chin over bar on pull-ups.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** % work + strict pull-ups (Preserve load, high skill)
    *   **B:** RPE 7-8, 8 thrusters + banded strict pull-ups (Reduce volume, keep pattern)
    *   **C:** DB front squat 15/10kg + ring rows (Load-reduced, safe pattern)
*   **Top Cues:** "Push the floor apart." "Drive elbows high." "Pull the bar to you."
*   **Bottleneck:** Barbell/rig access. Stage all lanes before squats start.

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: Heavy squats + thruster/pull intervals. Prime legs, shoulders, and grip.*

*Equipment: Machine OR shuttle run area, Pull-up rig*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 2:00 easy machine (OR 30s shuttle runs) + 10 Air squats + 8 Scap pulls on rig
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 1:30 moderate machine (OR 20s shuttle runs) + 8 Tempo air squats (3s down) + 6 Active hangs (5s hold)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 1:00 hard machine (OR 15s shuttle runs) + 5 Jumping squats (stick landing) + 5 Kip swings
*   *Rest:* 30-60s between rounds.

*Machine Sub: If no machines, use shuttle runs (10m out/back) OR jumping jacks (2x time) + high knees.*

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Open ankles for squat depth + shoulders for front rack + lats for pull.*

*   **Front Rack Stretch on Rig:** 30s/side. Bar in front rack position, stretch lats. (Front squat + thruster catch)
*   **Couch Stretch:** 30s/side. Knee to wall, squeeze glute. (Hip extension for squat drive)

## Workout

**A) Strength: Front Squat (E2MOM x7)**
*Progressive load with volume taper. Week 5 of cycle.*

*   Set 1: 8 reps @ 75% 1RM
*   Set 2: 7 reps @ 78%
*   Set 3: 5 reps @ 81%
*   Set 4: 5 reps @ 85%
*   Set 5: 2 reps @ 87%
*   Set 6: 2 reps @ 87%
*   Set 7: 1 rep @ 90%

*Total Time: 14:00*

**[ Reset Window: 3-5:00 ]**
*   *Action:* Clear squat racks. Stage thrusters at pull-up stations. Quick water.

**Prep (Movement Primer):**
*Empty bar work + pull-up primer. Get fresh reps before intervals.*

*   5 Front squats (empty bar) + 5 Push press (empty bar) + 5 Thrusters (empty bar)
*   5 Scap pulls + 5 Kip swings + 3 Strict pull-ups (or jumping pull-ups)
*   *Test:* 5 thrusters + 5 pull-ups. Check rhythm and transitions.

*Total Time: 3:00*

**B) Conditioning: EMOM 14:00 (7 Rounds)**
*Every 2:00 for 7 rounds:*

*   10 Thrusters (40/25 kg)
*   10 Pull-ups
*   *Rest remaining time in the 2:00 window*

*Target Work Time: 30-45s per round (allows 75-90s rest)*

*Score: Mark "RX" if all rounds unbroken. Otherwise, note rounds where breaks occurred.*

## Cooldown (4-5 min)

**Protocol: Hybrid (Neural Reset + Active Recovery)**
*Heavy squats + high-power intervals = CNS load + lactate buildup.*

**1. Immediate Reset (60s)**
*   **Dead Hang from Rig:** 30-60s. Relaxed grip, decompress spine.
    *Unloads intervertebral discs after heavy axial loads.*
*   **Physiological Sighs:** 5-10 cycles. Double inhale (nose) → long exhale (mouth).
    *Resets vagal tone after max effort intervals.*

**2. Active Flush (3 min)**
*   Easy bike or row at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (caps intensity, triggers parasympathetic).
*   *Target: Lactate clearance via oxidative pathway. Sub: easy jog or walk.*

**3. Static Stretching (2 min)**
*Post-exertion muscle temperature optimal for tissue lengthening.*

*   **Couch Stretch:** 45s/side. Knee to wall, squeeze glute.
    *Rectus femoris/iliopsoas—releases hip flexor tension from squats.*
*   **Lat Stretch on Rig:** 45s/side. Arm overhead, lean away.
    *Latissimus dorsi—releases shoulder extension tension from pull-ups.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* 20s nasal, slow exhales.
*   *Bright spot:* "Did you keep thrusters unbroken?" "Consistent pull-up sets?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Drive elbows high on thrusters. Pull the bar to you on pull-ups."
*   *Logistics:* Log scores. Note any scaling used.

## Coach Notes

**Whiteboard Brief (≤3:00):**
1. **Stimulus:** Heavy squat progression + power intervals with rest built in.
2. **Flow:** Squat racks → 3-5 min reset → thruster/pull-up stations (stage before reset).
3. **Scaling:** A = % + strict pulls | B = RPE 7-8 + banded strict | C = DB + rows.
4. **Safety:** Front rack position. If wrist/elbow pain, use cross-arm grip or DBs today.

**During Squats:**
- Scan: Hip depth, elbows high, heels down.
- Cue: "Push the floor apart." (external focus)
- Triage: If elbows drop → "Drive elbows to the ceiling."

**During EMOM:**
- Target: 30-45s work = 75-90s rest. If over 1:00, scale load or reps.
- Cue: "Loose grip on the bar between thrusters and pulls." (efficiency)
- Triage: If pull-ups break early → band or switch to rows mid-workout.

**Debrief Focus:**
- Process win: "I scaled early and kept moving smoothly."
- Pacing win: "I held consistent work times across all rounds."
- Tech win: "My front rack stayed solid even when tired."
