# TUESDAY: Deadlift 1RM + Heavy Chipper

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Machine (Row/Bike/Ski OR Shuttles), Barbell, Plates
*   **Stimulus:** Max strength test + heavy deadlift/burpee grind (threshold pace).
*   **Standards:** Full hip/knee extension at top of DL. Hips + chest hit floor on burpee. Jump and land both sides of bar.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** Test 3-rep max + loads as written (Heavy strength focus)
    *   **B:** Skip test, use 70% estimated max for chipper loads (Reduce intensity, preserve pattern)
    *   **C:** DB deadlifts 20/12kg + Step-over burpees (Load/complexity reduced)
*   **Top Cues:** "Push the floor away." "Hips and shoulders rise together." "Launch up from the floor."
*   **Bottleneck:** Barbell lanes + loading time. Pre-stage plates before 1RM testing.

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: Max deadlift + heavy chipper. Prime posterior chain and explosive power.*

*Equipment: Machine OR shuttle run area, Barbell*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 2:00 easy machine (OR 30s shuttle runs) + 10 Good mornings (PVC/empty bar) + 8 Glute bridges
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 1:30 moderate machine (OR 20s shuttle runs) + 8 RDL (empty bar) + 6 Burpees (slow, quality)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 1:00 hard machine (OR 15s shuttle runs) + 5 Deadlifts (empty bar, fast) + 5 Burpee broad jumps
*   *Rest:* 30-60s between rounds.

*Machine Sub: If no machines, use shuttle runs (10m out/back) OR high knees (2x time).*

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Open hamstrings for deadlift ROM + ankles for burpee landing.*

*   **Pike Stretch (Elevated Foot):** 30s/side. Foot on box, hinge at hips, reach toward toes. (Hamstring length for DL setup)
*   **Deep Squat Hold:** 45s. Weight in heels, elbows push knees out. (Ankle/hip mobility for burpee bottom)

## Workout

**A) Strength: Find 1RM 3-Rep Deadlift (Tc: 10-12 min)**
*Build from 50% in 4-6 jumps. Rest 2-3 min between heavy sets.*

*Suggested progression (adjust based on feel):*
*   3 reps @ 50% (warmup)
*   3 reps @ 60%
*   3 reps @ 70%
*   3 reps @ 80%
*   3 reps @ 85-90% (work set)
*   3 reps @ max weight (1RM attempt)

*Coach Note: Stop if form breaks. Hips/shoulders must rise together. Back stays flat.*

**[ Reset Window: 5-7:00 ]**
*   *Action:* Strip bars to working loads for chipper. Stage plates. Quick water. Mental reset.

**Prep (Movement Primer):**
*Get fresh reps at working weights before the clock starts.*

*   5 Deadlifts @ 50% chipper load + 5 Burpees OTB (slow, check bar clearance)
*   3 Deadlifts @ 70% chipper load + 3 Burpees OTB (moderate speed)
*   *Test:* 2 DL @ working weight + 2 Burpees OTB. Check pacing.

*Total Time: 3:00*

**B) Conditioning: For Time (Tc: 12:00)**
*Descending volume, ascending load. Grind through fatigue.*

*   20 Deadlifts (80/50 kg)
*   20 Burpees Over-the-Bar
*   15 Deadlifts (90/60 kg)
*   15 Burpees Over-the-Bar
*   10 Deadlifts (100/70 kg)
*   10 Burpees Over-the-Bar
*   5 Deadlifts (110/80 kg)
*   5 Burpees Over-the-Bar

*Target Time: 8-11 minutes. Steady grind, don't redline early.*

*Score: Total time. Mark loads used if scaled.*

## Cooldown (4-5 min)

**Protocol: Active Recovery + Decompression**
*Max effort deadlifts + heavy chipper = spinal compression + CNS fatigue.*

**1. Immediate Reset (60s)**
*   **Child's Pose:** 30-60s. Knees wide, hips back, arms extended. Breathe into lower back.
    *Decompress lumbar spine after heavy deadlifts.*
*   **Physiological Sighs:** 5-10 cycles. Double inhale (nose) → long exhale (mouth).
    *Downregulate nervous system after max testing.*

**2. Active Flush (3 min)**
*   Easy walk or slow bike at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (caps intensity, promotes recovery).
*   *Target: Flush metabolites, reduce muscle stiffness. No lactate buildup.*

**3. Static Stretching (2 min)**
*Post-workout muscle temperature optimal for lengthening tight tissues.*

*   **Pigeon Pose:** 45s/side. Hips square, forward fold optional.
    *Deep hip rotators—glutes worked hard in deadlifts.*
*   **Hamstring Stretch (Elevated Foot):** 45s/side. Foot on box, hinge forward.
    *Hamstrings—primary mover in deadlift, tight after volume.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* 20s nasal, slow exhales.
*   *Bright spot:* "Did you hit a new 3RM?" "Maintained form under fatigue?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Hips and shoulders rise together on deadlifts."
*   *Logistics:* Log 1RM and chipper time. Note any scaling.

## Coach Notes

**Whiteboard Brief (≤3:00):**
1. **Stimulus:** Max strength test + heavy grind. Pace the chipper—don't sprint.
2. **Flow:** 1RM testing (10-12 min) → 5-7 min reset + load bars → prep (3 min) → chipper (12 min cap).
3. **Scaling:** A = test 3RM + RX loads | B = skip test, 70% estimated max | C = DBs + step-over burpees.
4. **Safety:** Flat back on all deadlifts. If back rounds, stop rep and reduce load.

**During 1RM Testing:**
- Scan: Bar path (vertical), back angle (flat), hip/shoulder timing (together).
- Cue: "Push the floor away." (external focus)
- Triage: If hips shoot up first → "Chest and hips move together."
- Safety: If back rounds on setup → reduce load immediately.

**During Chipper:**
- Target: Steady pace, 8-11 min finish. If under 6 min, loads too light. Over 12 min, scale.
- Cue: "Break deadlifts into small sets before you have to." (pacing)
- Triage: If form breaks → switch to DBs or reduce load mid-workout.

**Debrief Focus:**
- Strength win: "New 3RM or matched old PR."
- Pacing win: "Held consistent sets, didn't redline early."
- Tech win: "Kept back flat even when tired."
