# FRIDAY: Team BMU/C&J Ascending Ladder

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Machine (Row/Bike/Ski), Pull-up Rig, Barbell, Plates
*   **Stimulus:** Team of 2, ascending ladder. High skill + power output. Share work strategically.
*   **Standards:** Chin over bar at top of BMU (hips to bar, press out to full support). Full hip/knee extension + bar overhead (C&J). Both feet on pedals/damper (machine).
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Movement Complexity → Volume
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** Rx BMU + 70/45 kg C&J (High skill, heavy barbell)
    *   **B:** Strict pull-ups + strict dips (substitute for BMU) + 50/35 kg C&J (Reduce load, preserve strength pattern)
    *   **C:** Banded strict pull-ups + box dips (or push-ups) + 35/25 kg C&J (Complexity/load reduced)
*   **Top Cues:** "Launch the hips to the bar." "Drive elbows high." "Press the bar through the ceiling."
*   **Bottleneck:** Rig access + barbell lanes + machine availability. Stage all three stations per team before starting.

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: High-skill gymnastics + heavy barbell cycling. Prime shoulders, grip, and legs.*

*Equipment: Machine, Pull-up rig, Barbell (empty)*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 2:00 easy machine + 10 Scap pulls on rig + 8 Barbell deadlifts (empty bar)
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 1:30 moderate machine + 8 Kip swings + 6 Hang power cleans (empty bar) + 6 Active hangs (5s)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 1:00 hard machine + 5 Chest-to-bar pull-ups (or high pulls) + 5 Push press (empty bar) + 3 Jumping bar muscle-ups (or C2B attempts)
*   *Rest:* 30-60s between rounds.

*Machine Sub: If no machines available, row/bike/ski is required for workout, so ensure access or modify to running equivalent (e.g., 200m run per 20 cal).*

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Open shoulders for BMU pressing + lats for pull + hips for C&J catch.*

*   **Lat Stretch on Rig:** 30s/side. Arm overhead on bar, lean away. (Lat length for bar muscle-up + C&J pull)
*   **Deep Squat Hold:** 45s. Weight in heels, elbows push knees out. (Ankle/hip mobility for C&J catch)

## Workout

**Prep (Movement Primer):**
*Practice all three movements with partner. Establish work-sharing strategy.*

*   5 Chest-to-bar pull-ups (or BMU singles/progressions)
*   5 Hang power cleans (empty bar) → 3 Full C&J (light weight)
*   10 Cal machine (moderate pace)
*   *Strategy Discussion:* Decide who does what reps (e.g., "I'll do odd BMU, you do even" or "Switch every 2 reps").

*Total Time: 5:00*

**Conditioning: Team of 2, 26:00 AMRAP**
*Ascending ladder. Partners share work however they choose. Machine work can be split or solo.*

**Round 1:**
*   2 Bar Muscle-Ups
*   2 Clean & Jerks (70/45 kg)
*   20 Cal Machine

**Round 2:**
*   4 Bar Muscle-Ups
*   4 Clean & Jerks (70/45 kg)
*   20 Cal Machine

**Round 3:**
*   6 Bar Muscle-Ups
*   6 Clean & Jerks (70/45 kg)
*   20 Cal Machine

**Round 4:**
*   8 Bar Muscle-Ups
*   8 Clean & Jerks (70/45 kg)
*   20 Cal Machine

**...continue adding 2 BMU and 2 C&J each round. Cal machine stays constant at 20.*

*Target: 3-4 full rounds (including rounds with 6-8 BMU). Stay strategic on work splits.*

*Score: Total rounds + reps completed (count BMU + C&J only; machine is "buy-in" per round).*

*Work Strategy: Partner 1 does reps while Partner 2 rests, or split reps (e.g., "you-go, I-go"). Communicate clearly.*

## Cooldown (4-5 min)

**Protocol: Neural Calm + Grip/Shoulder Recovery**
*High-skill gymnastics + heavy barbell = CNS load + grip/shoulder fatigue.*

**1. Immediate Reset (60s)**
*   **Dead Hang from Rig:** 30-60s. Relaxed grip, let shoulders decompress.
    *Decompresses shoulders and releases grip tension after BMU volume.*
*   **Physiological Sighs:** 5-10 cycles. Double inhale (nose) → long exhale (mouth).
    *Downregulates nervous system after high-skill + power output.*

**2. Active Flush (3 min)**
*   Easy bike or row at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (caps intensity, triggers parasympathetic response).
*   *Target: Clear lactate from shoulders/legs. Promote recovery.*

**3. Static Stretching (2 min)**
*Post-workout muscle temperature optimal for tissue lengthening.*

*   **Puppy Pose:** 60s. Knees on floor, chest drops, arms extended.
    *Shoulders/lats—heavily taxed from BMU press-outs and overhead C&J.*
*   **Couch Stretch:** 45s/side. Knee to wall, squeeze glute.
    *Hip flexors/quads—worked hard in C&J drive and catch.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* 20s nasal, slow exhales.
*   *Bright spot:* "Clear strategy with partner?" "Consistent BMU efficiency?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Launch hips to the bar on BMU. Drive elbows high on C&J."
*   *Logistics:* Log rounds + reps. Note partner and any scaling.

## Coach Notes

**Whiteboard Brief (≤3:00):**
1. **Stimulus:** Ascending ladder with partner. High skill + heavy barbell. Share work smartly—don't burn out early.
2. **Flow:** Prep (5 min) → 26 min AMRAP. Each team needs rig access, barbell lane, and machine.
3. **Scaling:** A = Rx | B = Pull+dip + 50/35kg | C = Banded pulls + box dips + 35/25kg.
4. **Safety:** BMU—control the descent (don't drop). C&J—full lockout overhead. Machine—secure feet.

**During Workout:**
- Scan: BMU press-out (full elbow extension), C&J catch (depth + front rack), machine form (consistent damper/resistance).
- Cue: "Launch the hips to the bar." "Drive the bar up with your legs." (external focus)
- Triage: If BMU breaks down → strict pull + strict dip. If C&J slows significantly → reduce load mid-workout.
- Pacing: Target 3-4 full rounds. If stuck on Round 2, scale movements or load.

**Team Dynamics:**
- Work split: Encourage clear strategy before starting—"you-go, I-go" or "split evenly."
- Machine: One partner can do all 20 cal while other rests, or split 10/10. Whatever keeps flow smooth.
- Communication: "I've got 2 more" (BMU/C&J) or "Your turn" cues help maintain rhythm.

**BMU Progressions (if needed mid-workout):**
- Rx → Jumping BMU (band assist)
- Jumping BMU → Strict pull + Strict dip (separate movements)
- Strict pull/dip → Banded pull + Box dip (further regression)

**Debrief Focus:**
- Teamwork win: "We communicated every switch clearly."
- Efficiency win: "BMU stayed smooth even as reps increased."
- Strategy win: "We paced the barbell to avoid long rest breaks."
