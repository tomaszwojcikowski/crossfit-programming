## Scaling Notes

**Priority:** Load → Volume → Movement substitution
**Front Squats:** Use RPE 7-8 if no 1RM data (Week 6: working 78-93%)
**Snatch Complex:** Focus on positions and speed under bar; reduce load to maintain technique
**Overhead Squats:** From rack, not floor; build conservatively to true 1RM
**Gymnastics:** Strict before kipping; banded strict before rowing
**Team Work:** Equal work distribution; scale to preserve stimulus and maintain consistent rounds

---

## Technical Focus

**Monday:** Speed under bar on snatches, overhead stability
**Tuesday:** Front rack position, consistent squat depth
**Thursday:** Complex fluidity—minimize transitions between movements
**Team Days (Wed/Fri):** Clear communication, strategic work splits
