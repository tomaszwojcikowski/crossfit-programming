# MONDAY: Snatch Complex & Overhead Squat 1RM

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Barbell, Squat Rack, PVC pipe
*   **Stimulus:** Technical snatch complex progression + max overhead squat test.
*   **Standards:** Full depth OHS (hip crease below knee). Full extension on snatches. Snatch grip width.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** % work as written (High skill, technical focus)
    *   **B:** RPE 7-8 on complexes, Power snatch substitutions, OHS to heavy single (not 1RM)
    *   **C:** Muscle snatch + OHS with PVC/light bar, focus on positions
*   **Top Cues:** "Launch the bar up." "Fast elbows." "Push the bar through ceiling."
*   **Bottleneck:** Barbell/rack access. Individual work—stagger starts if needed.

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: Technical snatch work + heavy overhead squats. Prime shoulders, hips, and overhead stability.*

*Equipment: PVC pipe or Empty Barbell*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 2:00 continuous good mornings (PVC, slow pace) + 10 Pass-throughs (PVC) + 8 Overhead squats (PVC)
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 1:30 continuous snatch grip deadlifts (PVC, moderate pace) + 8 Hang muscle snatches (PVC) + 6 Overhead squats (PVC, tempo)

*   **Deep Squat Hold:** 45s. Hands clasped, elbows push knees out. (Hip/ankle mobility)
*   **Wrist Circles:** 30s. Both directions, prep for hook grip. (Wrist mobility for snatch)

## Workout

**A) Snatch Complex (Every 90s x 9 Sets)**
*Technical practice building through snatch variations. Focus: speed under bar.*

*   **Sets 1-3:** 1 Tall Snatch + 1 High Hang Squat Snatch + 3 Overhead Squats (Light, 40-50% 1RM)
*   **Sets 4-6:** 1 Snatch High Pull + 1 Hang Squat Snatch + 2 Overhead Squats
    *   Set 4: 6 reps @ 78% 1RM Snatch
    *   Set 5: 5 reps @ 81%
    *   Set 6: 4 reps @ 85%
*   **Sets 7-9:** 1 Squat Snatch (floor) + 1 Hang Squat Snatch + 1 Overhead Squat
    *   Set 7: 3 reps @ 87%
    *   Set 8: 2 reps @ 90%
    *   Set 9: 2 reps @ 90%

*Total Time: 13:30*

**[ Reset Window: 2-3:00 ]**
*   *Action:* Set up squat racks. Move to OHS from rack. Hydrate. Chalk hands.

**B) Overhead Squat 1RM (10:00 Time Cap)**
*Barbell taken from rack (not floor). Build in 3-5 jumps to heavy single.*

*   Start at 80-85% of estimated 1RM
*   Work up to true 1RM
*   **Final Test:** 1 @ 93% if 1RM achieved

*Total Time: 10:00*

## Cooldown (5 min)

**Protocol: Neural Reset + Light Stretching**
*Heavy overhead work + CNS demand = need for decompression.*

**1. Downshift Breathing (60s)**
*   Easy walk or bike. **Nasal breathing only.**
*   *Caps intensity, triggers parasympathetic response.*

**2. Static Stretching (4 min)**
*Target shoulders and hips after heavy overhead loads.*

*   **Puppy Pose (Thread Needle variation):** 60s. Hands forward, chest to ground.
    *Thoracic spine + shoulders—releases overhead tension.*
*   **Pigeon Pose:** 60s/side. Front knee bent 90°, back leg extended.
    *Deep glute (piriformis)—releases hip external rotators from squats.*
*   **Seated Forward Fold:** 60s. Legs extended, reach for toes.
    *Hamstrings + lower back—releases posterior chain tension from squats.*

**Debrief Prompts:**
*   "One bright spot?" (Process: "Kept elbows fast on catches." / Technique: "Hit depth on all OHS reps.")
*   Stimulus check: "Did the snatch complexes feel crisp or fatigued?"
*   Takeaway: "One cue to remember for next snatch session."
