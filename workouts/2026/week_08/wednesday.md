# WEDNESDAY: Team of 2 AMRAP (Gymnastics + Power)

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Pull-up Rig, Kettlebell 24/16kg, Box 50cm
*   **Stimulus:** Team endurance grind—gymnastics volume + explosive power movements.
*   **Standards:** T2B = toes touch bar simultaneously. Burpee to target = chest to ground, jump to touch overhead target. KB swing = American (overhead). Burpee box jump over = chest to ground, jump on box, jump off other side.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Volume → Complexity → Load
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** RX movements, split work evenly (High skill + coordination)
    *   **B:** 30 T2B/15 burpees/30 KB/15 burpee box jumps + knee raises/step to target/lighter KB/step-ups (Reduce volume + complexity)
    *   **C:** 20 hanging knee raises/10 burpees/20 KB 16/12/10 box step-overs (Load + complexity reduced)
*   **Top Cues:** "Kick toes to bar." "Jump to target." "Swing overhead." "Quick transitions."
*   **Bottleneck:** Rig + box sharing. Pair athletes at same station. One athlete works, one rests (alternate).

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: Team gymnastics + power endurance. Prime core, hips, and shoulders.*

*Equipment: Pull-up rig, Box, Light Kettlebell*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 20 Box step-ups (slow pace) + 30s bar hang + 5+5 Hanging knee raises
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 15 Box step-overs (moderate pace) + 10s Lsit + 8 Toes to hip height + 6 KB swings (amercian)

*   *Rest:* 30-60s between rounds.

## Mobility (90s)
*Open shoulders for hanging + hips for explosive jumps + thoracic for overhead.*

*   **Lat Stretch on Rig:** 30s/side. Hang from bar, relax one arm. (Shoulder extension for T2B)
*   **Deep Squat Hold:** 45s. Hands clasped, elbows push knees out. (Hip/ankle mobility for box jumps)

## Workout

**Prep (Movement Primer):**
*Test all movements at game pace. Coordinate partner splits.*

*   3 Toes-to-bar + 3 Burpees to target + 5 KB swings (game weight) + 3 Burpee box jumps over
*   **Partner Planning:** Decide split strategy (e.g., "I do 20 T2B, you do 20" OR "Switch every 10 reps")
*   *Total Time: 3-4:00*

**Conditioning: 25:00 AMRAP (Team of 2)**
*One athlete works, one rests. Alternate as needed.*

*   40 Toes-to-Bar
*   20 Burpees to Target (touch overhead object)
*   40 Kettlebell Swings (24/16 kg, American = overhead)
*   20 Burpee Box Jumps Over (50cm box)

*Target: 3-4+ rounds. Maintain steady pace, communicate splits clearly.*

*Score: Total rounds + reps completed as a team.*

## Cooldown (5 min)

**Protocol: Team Reset + Stretching**
*High-rep gymnastics + power = grip fatigue + spinal compression.*

**1. Partner Walk & Breathe (90s)**
*   Walk together, easy conversation pace.
*   **Nasal breathing only.**
*   *Social recovery + parasympathetic activation.*

**2. Static Stretching (4 min)**
*Target shoulders, hips, and lower back.*

*   **Child's Pose:** 60s. Knees wide, arms forward, forehead to ground.
    *Lower back + shoulders—decompresses spine after T2B.*
*   **Pigeon Pose:** 60s/side. Front knee bent 90°, back leg extended.
    *Deep glute (piriformis)—releases hip from jumps.*
*   **Seated Straddle:** 60s. Legs wide, fold forward.
    *Adductors + hamstrings—releases inner thigh from box jumps.*

---

**Debrief Prompts:**
*   "One bright spot?" (Teamwork: "Clear switch plan every station." / Pacing: "Kept small sets on T2B, no misses.")
*   Stimulus check: "Did you maintain consistent round times or slow down?"
*   Takeaway: "What split strategy worked best for your team?"
