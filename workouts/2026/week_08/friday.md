# FRIDAY: Team of 2 AMRAP (Pull + Power + Cardio)

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Pull-up Rig, Box 50cm, Dumbbells 22.5/15kg (pair), Machine (Row/Bike/Ski)
*   **Stimulus:** Team mixed-modal endurance—upper pull, loaded step, cardio, power.
*   **Standards:** Pull-ups = chin over bar, full extension at bottom. Box step-over = step up with DB, step down other side (both feet on top). Cal machine = full damper setting, count calories. DB hang snatch = alternating arms, DB from hang (mid-thigh), full lockout overhead.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Volume → Load → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** RX movements, split work evenly (High skill + endurance)
    *   **B:** 18 pull-ups/18 box step-overs/27 cal/36 DB snatches + banded strict pull-ups/lighter DB 15/10 (Reduce volume + load)
    *   **C:** 12 ring rows/12 step-ups/24 cal/24 DB snatches 12.5/7.5 (Load + complexity reduced)
*   **Top Cues:** "Pull the bar to you." "Step through center of foot." "Fast chain on machine." "Punch DB overhead."
*   **Bottleneck:** Rig + machine sharing. Pair athletes by ability. One athlete works, one rests (alternate).

*   5 Strict Pull-ups (or scaled version) + 5 Box step-overs w/DB (game weight) + 10 DB hang snatches (alternating)
*   *Total Time: 3-4:00*

*One athlete works, one rests. Alternate as needed.*

*   24 Pull-ups

*   36 Calorie Machine (Row/Bike/Ski)
*   48 Alternating DB Hang Snatches (22.5/15 kg, 24/arm)

*Target: 2-3+ rounds. Maintain steady pace, clear communication on switches.*

*Score: Total rounds + reps completed as a team.*

## Cooldown (5 min)

**Protocol: Team Reset + Stretching**
*High-rep pulling + loading = grip fatigue + shoulder/hip tension.*

**1. Partner Walk & Breathe (90s)**
*   Walk together, easy conversation pace.
*   **Nasal breathing only.**
*   *Social recovery + parasympathetic activation.*

**2. Static Stretching (4 min)**
*Target shoulders, hips, and back.*

*   **Puppy Pose:** 60s. Hands forward, chest to ground.
    *Thoracic spine + shoulders—releases tension from pull-ups.*
*   **Pigeon Pose:** 60s/side. Front knee bent 90°, back leg extended.
    *Deep glute (piriformis)—releases hip from step-overs.*
*   **Lying Quad Stretch:** 45s/side. Side-lying, pull heel to glute.
    *Rectus femoris—releases quad tension from box step-overs.*
    **Wrists stretch** 60s
