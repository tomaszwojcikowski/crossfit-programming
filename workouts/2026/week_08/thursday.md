# THURSDAY: Barbell Complex Intervals (E2:30 x10)

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Barbell 50/25kg, PVC pipe
*   **Stimulus:** High-skill barbell complex with moderate load—power, front rack, overhead stability.
*   **Standards:** Hang clean = bar from mid-thigh, full squat catch. Push press = dip-drive to lockout. Thruster = squat to full overhead. OH lunge = barbell overhead, alternate legs (12 total steps = 6/leg).
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** 50/25kg RX (Moderate load, high skill)
    *   **B:** 40/20kg + 3 hang clean/3 push press/5 thruster/5 OH lunge (Reduce load + volume)
    *   **C:** 30/15kg + power clean/DB press/DB thruster/front rack lunge (Load-reduced, simpler patterns)
*   **Top Cues:** "Fast elbows on catch." "Drive bar up." "Stay tight overhead." "Keep chest up on lunges."
*   **Bottleneck:** Barbell access. Individual lanes. Start together, work independently.

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: Moderate-heavy barbell complex with overhead stability. Prime shoulders, hips, and core.*

*Equipment: PVC pipe or Empty Barbell*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 2:00 continuous front squats (PVC, slow pace) + 10 Pass-throughs (PVC) + 8 Good mornings (PVC)
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 1:30 continuous thrusters (PVC, moderate pace) + 8 Hang muscle cleans (PVC) + 6 Push press (PVC)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 1:00 continuous thrusters (PVC, fast tempo) + 5 Power cleans (PVC, explosive) + 5 OH lunges (PVC, each side)
*   *Rest:* 30-60s between rounds.

## Mobility (90s)
*Open shoulders for overhead + ankles/hips for deep positions + thoracic for lockout.*

*   **Front Rack Stretch on Rig:** 30s/side. Bar in front rack position, stretch lats. (Clean catch + thruster bottom)
*   **Couch Stretch:** 30s/side. Knee to wall, squeeze glute. (Hip extension for lunges)
*   **T-Spine Extension on Rig:** 30s. Hands on bar, push hips back, chest down. (Thoracic mobility for overhead)

## Workout

**Prep (Movement Primer):**
*Build through the complex with light-to-moderate load.*

*   Empty bar: 5 Hang clean + 5 Push press + 5 Thrusters + 5 OH lunges (total)
*   Light bar (30-40%): 4 Hang clean + 4 Push press + 6 Thrusters + 6 OH lunges
*   *Test at game weight:* 2 rounds of full complex. Check pace.

*Total Time: 5-6:00*

**Conditioning: Every 2:30 x 10 Sets**
*Complete all movements, then rest remaining time.*

*   4 Hang Squat Cleans (50/25 kg)
*   4 Push Press (50/25 kg)
*   6 Thrusters (50/25 kg)
*   6 Overhead Lunges (50/25 kg, alternating = 12 total steps)

*Target Work Time: 60-90s per round (allows 60-90s rest)*

*Total Time: 25:00*

*Score: Mark "RX" if all rounds completed unbroken. Otherwise, note where rest occurred.*

## Cooldown (5 min)

**Protocol: Active Recovery + Stretching**
*High-volume overhead work + lunges = shoulder/hip tension.*

**1. Downshift Breathing (60s)**
*   Easy bike or row at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only.**
*   *Clears metabolites, triggers parasympathetic response.*

**2. Static Stretching (4 min)**
*Target shoulders and hips after overhead + lunge volume.*

*   **Puppy Pose:** 60s. Hands forward, chest to ground.
    *Thoracic spine + shoulders—releases overhead tension.*
*   **Pigeon Pose:** 60s/side. Front knee bent 90°, back leg extended.
    *Deep glute (piriformis)—releases hip from lunges.*
*   **Forearm Stretch:** 45s/side. Fingers back, arm extended.
    *Wrist extensors/flexors—releases grip tension from barbell holding.*

**Debrief Prompts:**
*   "One bright spot?" (Technique: "Kept elbows high on cleans." / Pacing: "Stayed unbroken every round.")
*   Stimulus check: "Did the complex feel like a strength piece or a cardio grind?"
*   Takeaway: "What was the hardest part of the complex today?"
