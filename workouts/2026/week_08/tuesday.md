# TUESDAY: Front Squats & Mixed AMRAP

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Barbell, Squat Rack, Wall Ball, Jump Rope, Machine (Row/Bike/Ski)
*   **Stimulus:** Heavy front squat progression + moderate-intensity AMRAP (legs/shoulders/cardio).
*   **Standards:** Parallel depth on squats (hip crease below knee). Full extension at top. Wall ball hits target at 9'/10'. Lock out elbows overhead on double-unders.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** % work + RX wall balls/DUs (Preserve load + high skill)
    *   **B:** RPE 7-8 squats + 12 wall balls/15 cal/50 singles (Reduce volume, keep rhythm)
    *   **C:** Goblet squat 12/8kg + 10 med ball cleans 10/6kg/20 cal/jump attempts (Load-reduced, safe patterns)
*   **Top Cues:** "Push the floor apart." "Drive elbows high." "Hit the target." "Fast hands on rope."
*   **Bottleneck:** Barbell/rig access. Stage wall balls + ropes before AMRAP.

## Workout

**A) Strength: Front Squat (E2MOM x7)**
*Progressive load with volume taper. Week 6 of cycle.*

*   Set 1: 6 reps @ 78% 1RM
*   Set 2: 5 reps @ 81%
*   Set 3: 4 reps @ 85%
*   Set 4: 3 reps @ 87%
*   Set 5: 2 reps @ 90%
*   Set 6: 2 reps @ 90%
*   Set 7: 1 rep @ 93%

*Total Time: 14:00*

**[ Reset Window: 3-5:00 ]**
*   *Action:* Clear squat racks. Stage wall balls, ropes, machines. Quick water.

**Prep (Movement Primer):**
*Light wall ball + DU practice. Get fresh reps before AMRAP.*

*   5 Wall ball shots (game weight)
*   20 Singles → 10 Double-unders (or attempts)
*   5 Calorie machine (easy pace)
*   *Test:* 5 wall balls + 5 cal + 10 DUs. Check rhythm.

*Total Time: 3:00*

**B) Conditioning: 10:00 AMRAP**
*For max rounds + reps:*

*   15 Wall Ball Shots (10/6 kg to 3m/2.75m target)

*Score: Total rounds + reps completed.*

## Cooldown (5 min)

**Protocol: Active Recovery + Stretching**
*Heavy squats + moderate AMRAP = leg fatigue + shoulder tension.*

**1. Downshift Breathing (60s)**
*   Easy bike or row at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (caps intensity, triggers parasympathetic).
*   *Lactate clearance via oxidative pathway. Sub: easy walk.*

**2. Static Stretching (4 min)**
*Target legs and shoulders after front squats + wall balls.*

*   **Couch Stretch:** 60s/side. Knee to wall, squeeze glute.
    *Rectus femoris/iliopsoas—releases hip flexor tension.*
*   **Puppy Pose:** 60s. Hands forward, chest to ground.
    *Thoracic spine + shoulders—releases overhead tension from wall balls.*
*   **Calf Stretch on Wall:** 45s/side. Back leg straight, heel down.
    *Gastrocnemius/soleus—releases calf tension from jump rope.*

**Debrief Prompts:**
*   "One bright spot?" (Pacing: "Kept wall balls unbroken." / Process: "Smooth transitions to rope.")
*   Stimulus check: "Did you maintain consistent round times?"
*   Takeaway: "What would you change for next AMRAP with similar movements?"
