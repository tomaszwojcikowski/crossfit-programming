# MONDAY: Clean & Jerk EMOM & Team Machine Sprint

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Barbell, Cardio Machines (Row/Bike/Ski)
*   **Stimulus:** Heavy technical lifting under short rest, followed by a high-output team couplet.
*   **Standards:** Full extension on Clean & Jerk. Clear communication on machine switches.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** As written (50/25kg start, 60/35kg metcon).
    *   **B:** Lighter starting weight for EMOM, 40/25kg for metcon, 60/50 cal machine.
    *   **C:** Hang Power Clean + Push Press, 30/20kg, 40/30 cal machine.
*   **Top Cues:** "Fast elbows." "Drive through the heels." "Breathe on the machine."
*   **Bottleneck:** Machine availability. If short on machines, stagger starts or use different machines (Row/Bike/Ski) and balance calories.
