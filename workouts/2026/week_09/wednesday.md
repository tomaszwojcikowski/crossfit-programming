# WEDNESDAY: Endurance Intervals

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Rowers, Assault Bikes, Cones (for shuttles)
*   **Stimulus:** Long endurance piece with varied movements. Pacing is key.
*   **Standards:** Full extension on down ups. Touch lines on shuttles.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Volume → Load → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** As written (600/500m Row, 50 Shuttles, 1500/1300m AAB, Plank, 50 Down ups).
    *   **B:** 500/400m Row, 40 Shuttles, 1200/1000m AAB, Plank, 40 Down ups.
    *   **C:** 400/300m Row, 30 Shuttles, 1000/800m AAB, Plank, 30 Down ups.
*   **Top Cues:** "Breathe on the machine." "Keep moving on the down ups." "Hold the plank."
*   **Bottleneck:** Machine availability. Stagger starts or use different machines (Row/Bike/Ski) and balance distances.
