# MONDAY: Front Squats & Intervals

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Machine (Row/Bike/Ski), Barbell, Box
*   **Stimulus:** Strength push + explosive repeat sprint.
*   **Standards:** Parallel depth on squats. Both feet land on box.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** % work + 12/10 cal machine (High intensity)
    *   **B:** RPE 7-8, 10/8 cal machine (Reduce volume to keep intensity)
    *   **C:** DB front squat + step ups (Load-reduced, safe pattern)
*   **Top Cues:** "Push the floor apart." "Snap the hips open."
*   **Bottleneck:** Machine transitions. Stage boxes close to machines.

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Hybrid (Neural Reset + Metabolic Flush)**

*   **Physiological Sighs (30s)**
    *   Double inhale → long exhale, 5-10 cycles.

*   **Active Flush (3 min)**
    *   Machine or walk at 50-60% Max HR. Nasal breathing.

*   **Static Stretching (3 min):**
    *Post-workout recovery—longer holds, parasympathetic downshift.*
    *   **Pigeon Pose:** 60s/side. Hips square to floor. Releases deep glute tension from squats and box jumps.
    *   **Calf Stretch:** 60s/side. Wall lean, back leg straight. Restores gastrocnemius/soleus length after jumping volume.

*   **Debrief (during mobility):**
    *   *Bright Spot:* "Consistent machine pace?"
    *   *Takeaway:* "Drive through floor" for squats & jumps.
