# MONDAY: Front Squats & Intervals

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Machine (Row/Bike/Ski), Barbell, Box
*   **Stimulus:** Strength push + explosive repeat sprint.
*   **Standards:** Parallel depth on squats. Both feet land on box.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** % work + 12/10 cal machine (High intensity)
    *   **B:** RPE 7-8, 10/8 cal machine (Reduce volume to keep intensity)
    *   **C:** DB front squat + step ups (Load-reduced, safe pattern)
*   **Top Cues:** "Push the floor apart." "Snap the hips open."
*   **Bottleneck:** Machine transitions. Stage boxes close to machines.

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: Heavy squats + explosive intervals. Prime legs and hip drive.*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 2:00 easy machine + 10 Air squats + 8 Reverse lunges (alt)
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 1:30 moderate machine + 8 Tempo air squats (3s down) + 6 Squat jumps
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 1:00 hard machine + 5 Explosive squat jumps (stick landing)
*   *Rest:* 30-60s between rounds.

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Open ankles for squat depth + hips for explosive drive.*

*   **Ankle Rocks:** 30s/side. Knee forward over toes, heel down. (Squat depth + box landing)
*   **Couch Stretch:** 30s/side. Knee to wall, squeeze glute. (Hip extension for jumps)

## Workout

**A) Strength: Front Squat (E2MOM x7)**
*   3@70%, 3@70%, 3@70%, 5@75%, 2@80%, 2@80%, 1@85%

**[ Reset Window: 3-5:00 ]**
*   *Action:* Clear racks. Stage boxes. Quick water.

**Prep (Movement Primer):**
*   10 box step-ups, 5 box jumps (step down), 5 box jumps (plyo)
*   *Test:* 5 cal sprint + 3 box jumps. Check timing.

**B) Conditioning: 3 Rounds (1' ON / 1' OFF)**
*   12/10 Cal Machine
*   Remaining time: Max Box Jumps
*   *Target:* 80 Total Box Jumps.
*   *Note:* Score is total Box Jumps across all 3 rounds.

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Hybrid (Neural Reset + Metabolic Flush)**
*Heavy squats + explosive intervals = CNS stress + lactate accumulation.*

**1. Immediate Reset (60s)**
*   **Spinal Decompression:** Dead hang from rig, 30-60s.
    *Unloads intervertebral discs after heavy axial loading.*
*   **Physiological Sighs:** 5-10 cycles. Double inhale (nose) → long exhale (mouth).
    *Stay upright. Resets vagal tone after max effort.*

**2. Active Flush (4 min)**
*   Easy bike or row at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (caps intensity, triggers parasympathetic).
*   *Target: Lactate clearance via Cori cycle. 80% lactate threshold pace.*

**3. Static Stretching (2-3 min)**
*Elevated muscle temp = optimal window for tissue lengthening.*
*   **Couch Stretch:** 60s/side. Knee to wall, squeeze glute.
    *Rectus femoris/iliopsoas—prevents anterior pelvic tilt after squats.*
*   **Pigeon Pose:** 45s/side. Hips square, forward fold optional.
    *Deep hip rotators—releases glute medius tension from box jumps.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* 20s nasal, slow exhales.
*   *Bright spot:* "Consistent splits on the machine?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Push the floor apart" on all squatting.
