## Warmup (RAMP)

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** Row/Bike, 10 Scap pulls, 10 Deadlifts (Empty bar)
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** Row/Bike, 10 Kip swings, 10 Hang Power Cleans (Empty bar)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** Row/Bike, 5 Pull-ups, 5 Push Press (Empty bar)
*   *Cues:* "Shoulder tension." "Fast elbows."

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Pre-workout movement prep—dynamic positioning, not static stretching.*

*   **Lat Stretch on Rig (Latissimus Dorsi):** 30s/side. Grab rig post with one hand, step back and sit hips away, arm extended. Opens lats for bar muscle-up pulling mechanics and overhead push press lockout.
*   **Wrist Mobility (Flexion/Extension):** 30s total. Palms flat on floor (fingers toward knees) for flexors, then palms-up for extensors. Prepares wrists for barbell grip volume (hang power clean, push press) and BMU false grip.
*   **Front Rack Stretch (Shoulders/Wrists):** 45s. Elbows on bench or box, press chest down toward floor. Opens shoulder external rotation and wrist extension required for front rack hang power clean position and barbell cycling efficiency.

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Structural Hygiene (Post-Gymnastics)**

*   **Wrist Relief (60s)**
    *   Kneeling forearm stretches—palms down, then palms up.

*   **Active Flush (3 min)**
    *   Row or bike at 50-60% Max HR. Nasal breathing.

*   **Static Stretching (3 min):**
    *Post-workout recovery—longer holds, parasympathetic downshift.*
    *   **Pec Minor Release:** 90s/side. Lacrosse ball below collarbone. Releases shoulder tension from BMU pulling and overhead pressing volume.
    *   **Child's Pose with Side Reach:** 60s/side. Walk hands left/right. Restores lat and serratus length after high-volume barbell cycling.

*   **Debrief (during mobility):**
    *   *Bright Spot:* "Efficient partner transitions?"
    *   *Takeaway:* "Stay moving"—small sets preserve quality.
