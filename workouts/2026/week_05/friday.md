**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Barbell, Plates (50/30), Rig
*   **Stimulus:** High-volume technical gymnastics + barbell cycling.
*   **Standards:** Bar Muscle Up: Arms locked at top. T2B: Both toes touch bar.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** BMU, 50/30 kg Barbell
    *   **B:** Burpee Pull-up or C2B, 40/25 kg Barbell

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: High-volume BMU + barbell cycling. Build pulling + hip drive.*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 2:00 easy machine + 8 Deadlifts (empty bar) + 8 Strict press
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 1:30 moderate machine + 6 Hang power cleans + 6 Push press
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 1:00 hard machine + 4 Hang cleans + 4 Push press (build speed)
*   *Cues:* "Jump the bar to the shoulders." "Pop the bar off the shoulders."

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Open lats for pulling + front rack for barbell cycling.*

*   **Lat Stretch on Rig:** 30s/side. Grab rig, sit hips back. (BMU pull + overhead lockout)
*   **Front Rack Stretch:** 45s. Elbows on box, press chest down. (Clean catch + cycling efficiency)

## Workout

**Prep (Movement-Specific Primer, 3-5 min):**
*   Rig:
    *   5 Scap pulls + 5 Kip swings
    *   3-5 reps of your pull scale (BMU / C2B / pull-up)
    *   5 T2B or knee raises
*   Barbell:
    *   5 Hang power cleans + 5 Push press
*   *Goal:* Find your scale. Practice transitions with partner.*

**A) Team of 2: 23' AMRAP**
*   12 Bar Muscle Ups (Scale: C2B/Pull-ups)
*   36 Hang Power Cleans (50/30 kg)
*   36 Toes to Bar
*   36 Push Press (50/30 kg)
*   *Divide work as needed. One partner working at a time.*

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Structural Hygiene (Post-Gymnastics/Barbell)**
*BMU + barbell cycling = wrist strain + anterior shoulder tightness + lactate.*

**1. Immediate Wrist Relief (60s)**
*   **Kneeling Forearm Stretch:** 30s palms flat (fingers to knees), 30s palms up.
    *Non-negotiable after BMU false grip + barbell volume.*

**2. Active Flush (3 min)**
*   Easy row or bike at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (maintains skeletal muscle pump for metabolite clearance).
*   *Purpose: 23-min AMRAP produces significant lactate—flush it.*

**3. SMR & Stretch (3 min)**
*BMU pulling + push press = pec minor/lat shortening. Address both.*
*   **Pec Minor Release:** 60s/side. Lacrosse ball against rig post, just below collarbone.
    *Releases anterior shoulder tightness from 200+ pulling reps.*
*   **Banded Shoulder Distraction:** 60s/side. Band high on rig, wrist in loop (supinated), hinge and let arm stretch.
    *Opens glenohumeral joint—essential after high-volume T2B and BMU.*
*   **Child's Pose with Side Reach:** 45s/side. Walk hands L/R, sink hips back.
    *Lat/serratus length—counteracts barbell cycling and overhead pressing.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* Nasal, slow exhales.
*   *Bright spot examples:* "Transitions clean?" "Clear rep division?" "Kept moving when grip got tired?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Small sets, no misses."
