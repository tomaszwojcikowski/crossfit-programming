# FRIDAY: Team of 2 AMRAP: BMU & Barbell

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Barbell, Plates (50/30), Rig
*   **Stimulus:** High-volume technical gymnastics + barbell cycling.
*   **Standards:** Bar Muscle Up: Arms locked at top. T2B: Both toes touch bar.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Complexity → Load → Volume
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** BMU, 50/30 kg Barbell
    *   **B:** Burpee Pull-up or C2B, 40/25 kg Barbell
    *   **C:** Banded Pull-up or Ring Row, 30/20 kg Barbell, Hanging Knee Raises
*   **Top Cues:** "Big kip." "Drive through the heels." "Elbows fast."
*   **Bottleneck:** Barbell space and Rig space. Share bars if needed.

## Warmup (RAMP)

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** Row/Bike, 10 Scap pulls, 10 Deadlifts (Empty bar)
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** Row/Bike, 10 Kip swings, 10 Hang Power Cleans (Empty bar)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** Row/Bike, 5 Pull-ups, 5 Push Press (Empty bar)
*   *Cues:* "Shoulder tension." "Fast elbows."

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Pre-workout movement prep—dynamic positioning, not static stretching.*

*   **Lat Stretch on Rig (Latissimus Dorsi):** 30s/side. Grab rig post with one hand, step back and sit hips away, arm extended. Opens lats for bar muscle-up pulling mechanics and overhead push press lockout.
*   **Wrist Mobility (Flexion/Extension):** 30s total. Palms flat on floor (fingers toward knees) for flexors, then palms-up for extensors. Prepares wrists for barbell grip volume (hang power clean, push press) and BMU false grip.
*   **Front Rack Stretch (Shoulders/Wrists):** 45s. Elbows on bench or box, press chest down toward floor. Opens shoulder external rotation and wrist extension required for front rack hang power clean position and barbell cycling efficiency.

## Workout

**Prep (Movement-Specific Primer):**
*   3 BMU (or scale) → 5 Hang Power Cleans → 5 T2B → 5 Push Press
*   *Practicing transitions with partner.*

**A) Team of 2: 23' AMRAP**
*   12 Bar Muscle Ups (Scale: C2B/Pull-ups)
*   36 Hang Power Cleans (50/30 kg)
*   36 Toes to Bar
*   36 Push Press (50/30 kg)
*   *Divide work as needed. One partner working at a time.*

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Structural Hygiene (Post-Gymnastics/Barbell)**
*BMU + barbell cycling = wrist strain + anterior shoulder tightness + lactate.*

**1. Immediate Wrist Relief (60s)**
*   **Kneeling Forearm Stretch:** 30s palms flat (fingers to knees), 30s palms up.
    *Non-negotiable after BMU false grip + barbell volume.*

**2. Active Flush (3 min)**
*   Easy row or bike at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (maintains skeletal muscle pump for metabolite clearance).
*   *Purpose: 23-min AMRAP produces significant lactate—flush it.*

**3. SMR & Stretch (3 min)**
*BMU pulling + push press = pec minor/lat shortening. Address both.*
*   **Pec Minor Release:** 60s/side. Lacrosse ball against rig post, just below collarbone.
    *Releases anterior shoulder tightness from 200+ pulling reps.*
*   **Banded Shoulder Distraction:** 60s/side. Band high on rig, wrist in loop (supinated), hinge and let arm stretch.
    *Opens glenohumeral joint—essential after high-volume T2B and BMU.*
*   **Child's Pose with Side Reach:** 45s/side. Walk hands L/R, sink hips back.
    *Lat/serratus length—counteracts barbell cycling and overhead pressing.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* Nasal, slow exhales.
*   *Bright spot:* "Efficient partner transitions? Clear division of reps?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Small sets, stay moving"—quality over sprint.
