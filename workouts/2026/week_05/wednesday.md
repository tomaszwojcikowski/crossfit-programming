## Workout

**Prep (Movement-Specific Primer, 3-5 min):**
*   Build from empty bar:
    *   5 Pass-throughs → 5 Muscle snatches
    *   5 Snatch-grip RDL → 5 Snatch balances
    *   3 Squat snatches (build weight, stay crisp)
*   *Goal:* Find opening weight for EMOM. Zero misses.

**A) 16' EMOM (Technical Build)**
*   Minute 1: 2 Squat Snatches
*   Minute 2: 2 Hang Squat Snatches
*   Minute 3: 1 Hang Squat Snatch + 2 OHS
*   Minute 4: 1 Hang Squat Snatch + 4 Overhead Lunges
*   *Repeat 4 times. Increase weight slightly each round if movement remains crisp.*

**[ Reset Window: 3:00 ]**
*   *Action:* Quick water. Add weight for 1RM attempt.
*   *Mental:* Focus on one cue from the EMOM.

**B) Find 1RM Snatch (Tc: 8:00)**
*   Build to a heavy technical single.
*   *Goal:* Clean movement, no misses.

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Neural Reset (Post-Olympic Lifting)**
*1RM snatch = maximal CNS arousal + spinal loading. Low lactate, high neural stress.*

**1. Spinal Decompression (60-90s)**
*   **Dead Hang:** 60s on rig. Use straps if grip is fried.
    *Unloads lumbar/thoracic discs after heavy overhead catches.*
*   *Breathe:* Slow nasal inhales, long exhales while hanging.

**2. Walk & Box Breathe (3 min)**
*   Easy walk around gym. **No cyclic cardio needed** (lactate is minimal).
*   **Box Breathing:** Inhale 4s → Hold 4s → Exhale 4s → Hold 4s.
    *Regulates autonomic balance. Critical for calming "fried" CNS.*

**3. SMR & Stretch (3 min)**
*Overhead snatches = lat/thoracic tightness + hip flexor compression.*
*   **Glute Smash:** 90s/side. Lacrosse ball on glute medius, shift weight.
    *Releases deep hip tension from squat receiving position.*
*   **Child's Pose with Side Reach:** 45s/side. Walk hands L/R.
    *Lengthens lats and serratus after overhead lockout volume.*

**4. Debrief (supine, 2 min)**
*   Lie on back, legs up wall or extended. Continue box breathing.
*   *Bright spot examples:* "Heavy single with no misses?" "Stayed patient on the pull?" "Position felt solid?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Drag the bar, then punch fast."
