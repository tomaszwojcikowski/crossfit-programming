# WEDNESDAY: Snatch EMOM & 1RM

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Barbell, Plates, (Lifting shoes)
*   **Stimulus:** High-skill technical volume followed by heavy single.
*   **Standards:** Full squat (hip crease below knee). Locked out overhead.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Complexity → Load → Volume
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** As written (full snatch)
    *   **B:** Power Snatch + Overhead Squat (if limited depth)
    *   **C:** Snatch Pulls + Snatch Balance practice (focus on speed)
*   **Top Cues:** "Punch the bar up." "Sit tall." "Fast feet."
*   **Bottleneck:** Barbell space. No shared bars for 1RM.

## Warmup (RAMP)

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** Row/Bike, 10 Pass-throughs, 10 Overhead squats (PVC)
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** Row/Bike, 10 Snatch grip DL, 10 Muscle snatches (PVC/Empty bar)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** Row/Bike, 5 Snatch balances, 5 Squat snatches (Empty bar)
*   *Cues:* "Active shoulders." "Bar close."

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Pre-workout movement prep—dynamic positioning, not static stretching.*

*   **Thoracic Extension (T-spine Mobility):** 45s. Foam roller across mid-back, arms extended overhead. Opens thoracic vertebrae for vertical bar path in snatch pull and overhead receiving position.
*   **Wrist Mobility (Circumduction):** 30s total. Interlace fingers, rotate wrists in circles both directions. Prepares wrists for hook grip, overhead lockout position, and barbell turnover in the snatch.
*   **Ankle Stretch (Dorsiflexion):** 30s/side. Knee to wall drill, toes 4-6" away, drive knee forward. Essential for achieving deep squat receiving position in snatch and maintaining upright torso.

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Neural Reset (Post-Olympic Lifting)**
*1RM snatch = maximal CNS arousal + spinal loading. Low lactate, high neural stress.*

**1. Spinal Decompression (60-90s)**
*   **Dead Hang:** 60s on rig. Use straps if grip is fried.
    *Unloads lumbar/thoracic discs after heavy overhead catches.*
*   *Breathe:* Slow nasal inhales, long exhales while hanging.

**2. Walk & Box Breathe (3 min)**
*   Easy walk around gym. **No cyclic cardio needed** (lactate is minimal).
*   **Box Breathing:** Inhale 4s → Hold 4s → Exhale 4s → Hold 4s.
    *Regulates autonomic balance. Critical for calming "fried" CNS.*

**3. SMR & Stretch (3 min)**
*Overhead snatches = lat/thoracic tightness + hip flexor compression.*
*   **Glute Smash:** 90s/side. Lacrosse ball on glute medius, shift weight.
    *Releases deep hip tension from squat receiving position.*
*   **Child's Pose with Side Reach:** 45s/side. Walk hands L/R.
    *Lengthens lats and serratus after overhead lockout volume.*

**4. Debrief (supine, 2 min)**
*   Lie on back, legs up wall or extended. Continue box breathing.
*   *Bright spot:* "Heavy single clean? No misses?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Stay patient" on the pull—bar close, then fast.
