# TUESDAY: Team of 3 "Cindy" Variation

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** DBs (22.5/15), Pull-up bar, Machine
*   **Stimulus:** High volume gymnastics + steady engine work.
*   **Standards:** DB head touches floor. Chest to deck on push-ups. Chin over bar.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Complexity → Volume → Load
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** As written (22.5/15 DB, Cindy as written)
    *   **B:** 17.5/12.5 DB, Banded pull-ups/Incline push-ups
    *   **C:** DB Snatches to hang, Ring rows, Box push-ups
*   **Top Cues:** "Punch the ceiling." "Keep the core tight." "Breathe on the squats."
*   **Bottleneck:** Pull-up bar space. Assign lanes for each team.

## Warmup (RAMP)

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** Easy shuttle runs, 10 Scap pulls, 10 Push-ups to Down Dog
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** Moderate shuttle runs, 5 Kip swings, 10 Alt DB Snatches (light)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** Fast shuttle runs, 3 Pull-ups, 5 Down ups
*   *Cues:* "Active shoulders." "Drive with legs."

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Pre-workout movement prep—dynamic positioning, not static stretching.*

*   **Thoracic Extension (T-spine Mobility):** 45s. Place foam roller or medball across mid-back (below shoulder blades), arms overhead. Gently extend over roller. Opens thoracic spine for overhead DB snatch lockout and proper pull-up shoulder mechanics.
*   **Wrist Stretch (Flexors/Extensors):** 30s total. Kneeling position, palms flat (fingers toward knees) for flexors, then flip palms-up for extensors. Prepares wrists for DB grip, pull-up bar volume, and push-up hand loading.
*   **Lat Stretch on Rig (Latissimus Dorsi):** 30s/side. Grab rig post, step back and sit hips away, arm extended. Lengthens lats for pull-up range and overhead DB snatch position.

*   **Partner C:** 5 Down ups
*   *Rotation:* Switch when Partner C finishes 5 Down ups.

**[ Rest: 15:00 - 17:00 ]**

**Part 2 (17:00 - 32:00)**
*   **Partner A:** Max Distance Machine (Row/Bike/Ski)

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Metabolic Flush (Post-MetCon)**
*High-volume gymnastics + DB work = systemic lactate + grip/shoulder fatigue.*

**1. Immediate Reset (30-45s)**
*   **Physiological Sighs:** 5-10 cycles. Double inhale → long exhale.
    *Stay upright or walking. Do NOT lie down (prevents venous pooling).*

**2. Active Flush (4 min)**
*   Easy walk or bike at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (governs intensity, activates vagus nerve).
*   *Purpose: Maintain skeletal muscle pump → flush metabolites via Cori cycle.*

**3. Structural Restoration (3 min)**
*Pull-up volume + push-ups = anterior shoulder tightness + wrist strain.*
*   **Wrist Relief:** 45s total. Palms flat (fingers to knees), then palms up.
    *Releases forearm flexors/extensors from grip volume.*
*   **Thread the Needle:** 45s/side. Lie on side, reach under and rotate.
    *T-spine rotation—counteracts rounded posture from push-ups.*
*   **Pigeon Pose:** 45s/side. Hips square, relax forward.
    *Hip rotators—restores length after 200+ air squats in Cindy.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* Slow nasal exhales.
*   *Bright spot:* "Clear rotation plan with partners?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Sustainable pace beats redline" over 30 min.
