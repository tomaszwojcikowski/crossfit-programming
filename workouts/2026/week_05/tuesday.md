## Warmup (RAMP)

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** Easy shuttle runs, 10 Scap pulls, 10 Push-ups to Down Dog
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** Moderate shuttle runs, 5 Kip swings, 10 Alt DB Snatches (light)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** Fast shuttle runs, 3 Pull-ups, 5 Down ups
*   *Cues:* "Active shoulders." "Drive with legs."

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Pre-workout movement prep—dynamic positioning, not static stretching.*

*   **Thoracic Extension (T-spine Mobility):** 45s. Place foam roller or medball across mid-back (below shoulder blades), arms overhead. Gently extend over roller. Opens thoracic spine for overhead DB snatch lockout and proper pull-up shoulder mechanics.
*   **Wrist Stretch (Flexors/Extensors):** 30s total. Kneeling position, palms flat (fingers toward knees) for flexors, then flip palms-up for extensors. Prepares wrists for DB grip, pull-up bar volume, and push-up hand loading.
*   **Lat Stretch on Rig (Latissimus Dorsi):** 30s/side. Grab rig post, step back and sit hips away, arm extended. Lengthens lats for pull-up range and overhead DB snatch position.
