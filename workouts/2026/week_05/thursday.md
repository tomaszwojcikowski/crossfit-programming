# THURSDAY: DU Practice & Bodyweight Engine

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Jump Rope
*   **Stimulus:** Skill under pressure + sustained aerobic effort.
*   **Standards:** Both feet leave floor together (DU). Chest to deck (Push-ups).
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** DU as written
    *   **B:** Reduce DU reps OR practice 30s per round
    *   **C:** Single unders (60 reps)
*   **Top Cues:** "Spin the rope fast." "Stay light on the ground." "Run tall and smooth."
*   **Bottleneck:** Running lane space. Group starts together.

---

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: Skill (DU) under fatigue + 1800m running. Prime calves and core.*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 400m easy jog + 10 Calf raises + 8 Air squats
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 300m moderate jog + 10 Hollow rocks + 20 Single unders
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 200m fast run + 5 V-ups + 10 DU attempts
*   *Cues:* "Bounce off the ground." "Spin the rope fast."

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Open calves for DU impact + hip flexors for running stride.*

*   **Calf Stretch:** 45s/side. Wall lean, back leg straight. (1800m running + DU bounce)
*   **Cobra:** 45s. Press chest up, hips down. (Opens hip flexors for stride length)

## Workout

**A) Skill: Double Under Practice (Tc: 8:00)**
*   Goal: Complete the ladder UNBROKEN
*   5-10-15-20-25-30-25-20-15-10-5
*   *If you break, restart that set.*
*   *Scale:* Practice DU for 8 min OR perform single unders.

**[ Reset Window: 4:00 ]**
*   *Action:* Clear floor. Prep for running.
*   1 lap run, 5 V-ups, 5 push-ups, 10 DU

**B) Conditioning: 6 Rounds for Time (Tc: 18:00)**
*   3 Lap Run (~300m)
*   15 V-ups
*   15 Push-ups
*   30 Double Unders (Scale: 60 Single Unders)

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Metabolic Flush (Post-MetCon)**
*1800m running + DU + V-ups = calf stress + hip flexor fatigue + lactate.*

**1. Immediate Reset (30-45s)**
*   **Physiological Sighs:** 5-10 cycles. Double inhale → long exhale.
    *Keep walking. Head above heart to prevent dizziness.*

**2. Active Flush (4 min)**
*   Easy walk or light jog at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (activates NO production via Bohr effect).
*   *Target: Accelerate lactate clearance by 40% vs passive rest.*

**3. Static Stretching (3 min)**
*Running volume = gastrocnemius/soleus tightness. V-ups = hip flexor fatigue.*
*   **Calf Stretch (gastrocnemius):** 45s/side. Wall lean, back leg straight, heel down.
    *Restores calf length—prevents Achilles strain after 1800m.*
*   **Downward Dog:** 60s. Press heels toward floor, spread fingers.
    *Full posterior chain—hamstrings, calves, lats in one position.*
*   **Reclined Twist:** 45s/side. Knee across body, opposite arm extended.
    *QL/glute medius release—counteracts rotational stress from running.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* Slow nasal exhales.
*   *Bright spot examples:* "DU rhythm stayed calm?" "Held pace on the runs?" "V-ups unbroken?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Spin the rope fast, jump low."
