# THURSDAY: DU Practice & Bodyweight Engine

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Jump Rope
*   **Stimulus:** Skill under pressure + sustained aerobic effort.
*   **Standards:** Both feet leave floor together (DU). Chest to deck (Push-ups).
*   **Scaling Priority:** Volume → Complexity → Load
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** DU as written
    *   **B:** Reduce DU reps OR practice 30s per round
    *   **C:** Single unders (60 reps)
*   **Top Cues:** "Relax the shoulders." "Fast wrists." "Breathe on the run."
*   **Bottleneck:** Running lane space. Group starts together.

## Warmup (RAMP)

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 400m easy jog, 10 Scap push-ups, 20 Calf raises
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 300m mod jog, 10 Hollow rocks, 20 Single unders
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 200m fast run, 5 V-ups, 10 Double unders or attempts
*   *Cues:* "Eyes on the horizon." "Stay light on feet."

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Pre-workout movement prep—dynamic positioning, not static stretching.*

*   **Calf Stretch (Gastrocnemius/Soleus):** 45s/side. Lean into wall with back leg straight, heel down (targets gastrocnemius). Prepares calves for DU impact and 1800m total running volume to prevent cramping and Achilles strain.
*   **Cobra Stretch (Hip Flexors/Abs):** 45s. Lie prone, press chest up with straight arms, hips on floor. Opens hip flexors and rectus abdominis for running stride length and counteracts V-up core flexion.
*   **Wrist Circles (Joint Preparation):** 30s. Interlace fingers, rotate wrists in both directions. Prepares wrists for DU rope grip and push-up hand loading.
