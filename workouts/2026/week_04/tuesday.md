# TUESDAY: Gymnastics & KB

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Rig/Rings, KB, Wall
*   **Stimulus:** Clean skill under fatigue. Smooth transitions.
*   **Standards:** Controlled transitions. Stable shoulders.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** 5 Strict Pull-up + 5 Dips (full strength stimulus)
    *   **B:** Banded strict pull-ups + assisted dips (harder movement, reduced load)
    *   **C:** Ring rows + push-ups (preserve pattern, simplify complexity)
*   **Top Cues:** "Reach long." "Narrow grip." "Small sets."
*   **Bottleneck:** 2 stations (pull / wall). Rotate.
