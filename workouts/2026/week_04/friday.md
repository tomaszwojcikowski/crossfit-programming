# FRIDAY: Devil Press & Machine

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Machine, DBs, Box, Ball
*   **Stimulus:** Aerobic grind + clean mechanics.
*   **Standards:** Chest down. DBs overhead. Controlled step.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** As written (full stimulus)
    *   **B:** Lighter DBs / lower box / reduced cals (45/35) (reduce load, preserve movement)
    *   **C:** Burpee + push press; step-ups (not step-overs) (simplify pattern)
    *   **Pregnancy:** Elevated push-up on box + step-ups; step-back pattern (no jump)
*   **Top Cues:** "Sit to wall." "Breathe low." "Smooth step."
*   **Bottleneck:** Pre-assign machine order. Share Wall Ball.

## Warmup (RAMP)

*   **R1 (Mach 2:00):** DB DL x8, Alt Lunge x12
*   **R2 (Mach 1:30):** Hang High Pull x6, Push-up Down Dog x8
*   **R3 (Mach 1:00):** Power Snatch x4, Thruster jump x8
*   *Cues:* "Step far." "Push floor away." "Launch hands."

## Mobility (60-90s)

*   **Cossack Squat (Adductors/Lateral Hip):** 30s/side. Wide stance, shift weight to one side, sink into deep squat on that leg while keeping opposite leg straight. Opens adductors and lateral hip for box step-over range and devil press wide stance.
*   **Banded Shoulder Distraction (Glenohumeral Joint):** 30s/side. Loop band on rig, wrist inside (palm up), step back to create tension. Distracts shoulder joint to prepare for overhead devil press lockout and wall ball throws.
*   **Hip Flexor Stretch (Psoas/Rectus Femoris):** 30s/side. Lunge position, back knee down, drive hips forward. Prepares hip flexors for repetitive box step-over hip extension and burpee bottom position.
