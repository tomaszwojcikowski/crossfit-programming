# WEDNESDAY: Thrusters & Team

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Rig, Barbell, Plate/Line
*   **Stimulus:** Heavy tech single + fast team engine.
*   **Standards:** Hip below knee. Lockout. Chest to floor.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** Build to tech single; AMRAP as written (full stimulus)
    *   **B:** 3-5RM instead of 1RM; lighter thrusters; strict pull-ups (reduce load, keep pattern)
    *   **C:** Front squat (not DB); ring rows (not pull-ups); preserve strength focus
    *   **Pregnancy:** Step-back burpee to plate (no jump); elevated push-up on box
*   **Top Cues:** "Elbows forward." "Launch bar." "Tag & go."
*   **Bottleneck:** Pairs share bar. Pre-set pull-up stations.
