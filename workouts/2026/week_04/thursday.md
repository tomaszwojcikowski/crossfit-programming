# THURSDAY: 25' EMOM

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Rope, Rig, KB, Medball
*   **Stimulus:** Sustainable pace. 10-20s rest/station.
*   **Standards:** Consistent reps. Safe kips.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** As written (full EMOM reps, 10-20s rest per station)
    *   **B:** Reduce reps to finish <45s per station (preserve pace, reduce volume)
    *   **C:** Knee raises (not T2B); single unders (simplify skill, same stimulus)
*   **Top Cues:** "Smooth breath." "Finish early." "Same pace."
*   **Bottleneck:** Assign starting stations. Count transitions.
