# FRIDAY: Team of 2 — 40 Rounds KB/HSPU/Clean

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Kettlebells (24/16 kg), Rig/Wall, Barbell (80/55 kg)
*   **Stimulus:** High-volume grind—accumulate work across 40 rounds with partner.
*   **Standards:** KB swings to eye level (Russian) or overhead (American). HSPU: Head touches floor, arms locked at top. Power Clean: Full hip extension.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** 24/16 KB, Strict/Kipping HSPU, 80/55 kg Clean
    *   **B:** 20/12 KB, Box Pike HSPU or DB Push Press, 60/40 kg Clean
    *   **C:** 16/12 KB swings, Push-ups, 50/30 kg Clean
*   **Top Cues:** "Snap the hips." "Press through the floor." "Jump the bar to the shoulders."
*   **Bottleneck:** HSPU wall space + single barbell. Rotate efficiently.

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: High-rep KB + HSPU + heavy single clean. Prime hips, shoulders, and pulling mechanics (no machines).*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 2:00 easy cardio (walk/jog or jumping jacks) + 10 KB deadlifts + 8 Shoulder taps (slow)
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 1:30 moderate cardio (shuttle runs) + 8 KB swings russian + 5 Pike push-ups
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 1:00 hard cardio (shuttle runs) + 5 KB swings (american) + 3 wall walks
*   *Cues:* "Snap the hips." "Press through the floor."

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Open shoulders for HSPU + hips for cleans.*

*   **Shoulder Stretch on Rig:** 30s/side. Grab rig, sit hips back. (Overhead lockout for HSPU)
*   **Hip Flexor Stretch:** 30s/side. Lunge position, squeeze glute. (Clean extension + KB hinge)

## Workout

**Prep (Movement-Specific Primer, 3-5 min):**
*   KB: 8 KB swings (working weight)
*   Wall:
    *   3 Wall walks OR 5 HSPU (or scale)
    *   Confirm depth standard
*   Barbell:
    *   5 Deadlifts + 5 Hang power cleans + 3 Power cleans (build to working weight)
*   *Goal:* Confirm all scales. Practice rotation with partner.

**A) Team of 2: 40 Rounds For Time**
*   10 Kettlebell Swings (24/16 kg)
*   5 Handstand Push-ups
*   1 Power Clean (80/55 kg)

*Divide work as needed. One partner works at a time.*
*Suggested split: Alternate full rounds OR split by movement.*

*Target:* Sub 30:00 (aim for ~45s/round average)

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Structural Hygiene (Post-High Volume)**
*40 rounds = significant shoulder fatigue + grip stress + hip hinge volume.*

**1. Immediate Wrist Relief (60s)**
*   **Kneeling Forearm Stretch:** 30s palms flat (fingers to knees), 30s palms up.
    *Non-negotiable after 200 HSPU reps (team total) + KB grip.*

**2. Active Flush (3 min)**
*   Easy walk or light jog at RPE 2-3/10.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (maintains skeletal muscle pump for metabolite clearance).
*   *Purpose: Extended grind produces sustained lactate—flush it.*

**3. SMR & Stretch (3 min)**
*HSPU + KB swings = anterior shoulder + posterior chain tightness.*
*   **Pec Minor Release:** 60s/side. Lacrosse ball against rig post, just below collarbone.
    *Releases anterior shoulder tightness from 200 pressing reps.*
*   **Child's Pose with Side Reach:** 45s/side. Walk hands L/R, sink hips back.
    *Lat/serratus length—counteracts KB swings and HSPU.*
*   **Figure-4 Stretch:** 45s/side. Lie on back, ankle on opposite knee.
    *Glute/piriformis release after 40 heavy cleans.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* Nasal, slow exhales.
*   *Bright spot examples:* "Consistent round times?" "Clear rotation plan?" "HSPU stayed crisp?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Sustainable pace, no failed reps."
