## Workout

**Prep (Movement-Specific Primer, 3-5 min):**
*   MB: 5 Medball air squats (working weight)
*   DB: 5 Alt DB snatches (working weight)
*   Wall: 2 Wall walks OR 5m HSW practice
*   Rope: 1 Rope climb OR 3 rope pulls from floor
*   Core: 20s Plank hold
*   *Goal:* Confirm all scales. Practice station-to-station flow.

**A) 25' EMOM (5 Rounds)**

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Metabolic Flush (Post-EMOM)**
*25 minutes of mixed modal = moderate lactate + full-body fatigue.*

**1. Immediate Reset (30-45s)**
*   **Physiological Sighs:** 5-10 cycles. Double inhale → long exhale.
    *Stay upright or walking. Steady the breathing after sustained work.*

**2. Active Flush (4 min)**
*   Easy walk or bike at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (activates parasympathetic, clears metabolites).
*   *Purpose: Maintain blood flow through all muscle groups worked.*

**3. Static Stretching (3 min)**
*HSW + rope = wrist/shoulder stress. Squats + snatches = hip/posterior chain.*
*   **Wrist Stretch:** 30s. Palms flat, fingers toward knees.
    *Releases forearm flexors after HSW and rope grip.*
*   **Puppy Pose:** 45s. Knees down, arms extended, chest melts to floor.
    *Opens lats/shoulders after inversion and overhead work.*
*   **Pigeon Pose:** 45s/side. Hips square, relax forward.
    *Hip rotators—releases tension from squats and snatches.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* Slow nasal exhales.
*   *Bright spot examples:* "All rounds completed on time?" "HSW felt controlled?" "Rope climbs smooth?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Sustainable pace across all 5 rounds."
