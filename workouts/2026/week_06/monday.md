# MONDAY: Front Squats & Wall Ball/DU Chipper

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Barbell, Plates, Wall Ball (10/6 kg), Jump Rope
*   **Stimulus:** Strength push + descending volume chipper (race the clock).
*   **Standards:** Parallel depth on squats. Ball hits target. Both feet leave floor (DU).
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** % work, 10/6 kg ball, DU as written
    *   **B:** RPE 7-8, 8/5 kg ball, reduce DU by half
    *   **C:** DB front squat, light ball, single unders (2x reps)
*   **Top Cues:** "Push the floor apart." "Drive through the ball." "Spin the rope fast."
*   **Bottleneck:** Wall ball targets + DU space. Stage lanes before squats.

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: Heavy squats + wall ball/DU chipper. Prime legs, hip drive, and coordination.*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 2:00 easy machine + 10 Air squats + 8 Medball deadlifts
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 1:30 moderate machine + 8 Tempo air squats (3s down) + 6 Wall balls (light)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 1:00 hard machine + 5 Wall ball (full speed) + 20 Single unders
*   *Rest:* 30-60s between rounds.

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Open ankles for squat depth + hips for wall ball drive.*

*   **Ankle Rocks:** 30s/side. Knee forward over toes, heel down. (Squat depth + WB catch)
*   **Hip Flexor Stretch:** 30s/side. Lunge position, squeeze glute. (Hip extension for wall ball)

## Workout

**A) Strength: Front Squat (E2MOM x7)**
*   8@72%, 7@75%, 6@77%, 5@80%, 2@85%, 2@85%, 1@87%

**[ Reset Window: 3-5:00 ]**
*   *Action:* Clear racks. Stage wall balls and ropes. Quick water.

**Prep (Movement Primer):**
*   5 Wall balls (light) + 10 Single unders
*   5 Wall balls (working weight) + 10 DU attempts
*   *Test:* 5 WB + 10 DU unbroken. Check rhythm.

**B) Conditioning: For Time (Tc: 12:00)**
*   30 Wall Ball Shots (10/6 kg) *unbroken*
*   60 Double Unders
*   25 Wall Ball Shots
*   50 Double Unders
*   20 Wall Ball Shots
*   40 Double Unders
*   15 Wall Ball Shots
*   30 Double Unders
*   *Target:* Sub 10:00. Descending volume = maintain pace.

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Hybrid (Neural Reset + Metabolic Flush)**
*Heavy squats + high-rep chipper = CNS stress + lactate accumulation.*

**1. Immediate Reset (60s)**
*   **Spinal Decompression:** Dead hang from rig, 30-60s.
    *Unloads intervertebral discs after heavy axial loading.*
*   **Physiological Sighs:** 5-10 cycles. Double inhale (nose) → long exhale (mouth).
    *Stay upright. Resets vagal tone after max effort.*

**2. Active Flush (4 min)**
*   Easy bike or row at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (caps intensity, triggers parasympathetic).
*   *Target: Lactate clearance via Cori cycle.*

**3. Static Stretching (2-3 min)**
*Elevated muscle temp = optimal window for tissue lengthening.*
*   **Couch Stretch:** 60s/side. Knee to wall, squeeze glute.
    *Rectus femoris/iliopsoas—prevents anterior pelvic tilt after squats.*
*   **Pigeon Pose:** 45s/side. Hips square, forward fold optional.
    *Deep hip rotators—releases glute tension from wall ball drive.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* 20s nasal, slow exhales.
*   *Bright spot:* "Held unbroken on opening wall balls?" "DU rhythm stayed consistent?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Push the floor apart" on all squatting.
