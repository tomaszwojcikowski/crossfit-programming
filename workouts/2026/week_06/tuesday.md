# TUESDAY: Team of 2 Triplet Repeats

**Setup:**
*   **Time:** 60:00 Cap | **Equip:** Barbell (50/25 kg), Pull-up Bar, Box
*   **Stimulus:** High-volume gymnastics + barbell cycling in wave format.
*   **Standards:** T2B: Both toes touch bar. Burpee OTB: Two-foot jump over bar. Power Snatch: Full extension at top.
*   **Scaling Priority:** Load → Volume → Complexity
*   **Scaling:**
    *   **A:** As written (50/25 kg, T2B)
    *   **B:** 40/20 kg, Hanging Knee Raises, Burpee step-overs
    *   **C:** 30/15 kg, Sit-ups, Burpee no jump
*   **Top Cues:** "Kick toes to the bar." "Snap the hips open." "Jump the bar to the shoulders."
*   **Bottleneck:** Barbell and rig space. One partner working = one bar per team.

## Warmup (RAMP)
*Stimulus: High-volume T2B + barbell cycling. Build hip drive, core engagement, pulling mechanics.*

*   **R1 (2:00 easy):** 2:00 easy shuttle runs + 8 Deadlifts (empty bar) + 8 Air squats
*   **R2 (1:30 mod):** 1:30 moderate shuttle runs + 8 Hanging knee raises + 6 Hang power cleans (light)
*   **R3 (1:00 hard):** 1:00 hard shuttle runs + 5 Down ups + 3 Power snatches (light)
*   *Cues:* "Kick toes to the bar." "Snap the hips open."

## Mobility (60-90s)
*Open lats for T2B hang + hips for snatch pull.*

*   **Lat Stretch on Rig:** 30s/side. Grab rig, sit hips back. (T2B hang position + snatch lockout)
*   **Hip Flexor Stretch:** 30s/side. Lunge position, squeeze glute. (Snatch extension + burpee recovery)

## Workout

**Prep (Movement-Specific Primer, 3-5 min):**
*   2 rounds:
    *   5 Scap pulls + 5 Kip swings + 3 T2B (or scale)
    *   5 Deadlifts + 3 Hang power cleans + 3 Power snatches (light)
    *   3 Burpees over bar
*   *Goal:* Find T2B scale. Test snatch weight. Practice partner transitions.

**Team of 2 Conditioning**

**Part 1: For Time**
*   75 Toes to Bar
*   50 Burpee Over the Bar
*   25 Power Snatches (50/25 kg)

**[ Rest: 2:00 ]**

**Part 2: For Time**
*   75 Hang Power Cleans (50/25 kg)
*   50 Burpee Over the Bar
*   25 Power Snatches (50/25 kg)

**[ Rest: 2:00 ]**

**Part 3: For Time**
*   75 Toes to Bar
*   50 Burpee Over the Bar
*   25 Power Snatches (50/25 kg)

*Divide work as needed. One partner working at a time.*

## Cooldown (5-7 min)

**Protocol: Metabolic Flush (Post-MetCon)**
*High-volume T2B + barbell cycling + burpees = systemic lactate + grip/hip flexor fatigue.*

**1. Immediate Reset (30-45s)**
*   **Physiological Sighs:** 5-10 cycles. Double inhale → long exhale.
    *Stay upright or walking. Do NOT lie down (prevents venous pooling).*

**2. Active Flush (4 min)**
*   Easy walk or bike at 50-60% Max HR.
*   **Nasal breathing only** (governs intensity, activates vagus nerve).
*   *Purpose: Maintain skeletal muscle pump → flush metabolites via Cori cycle.*

**3. Structural Restoration (3 min)**
*T2B volume = lat/hip flexor tightness. Burpees = systemic fatigue.*
*   **Dead Hang:** 45s. Relax shoulders, let spine decompress.
    *Releases lat tension from 150 T2B across all parts.*
*   **Pigeon Pose:** 45s/side. Hips square, relax forward.
    *Hip rotators—restores length after burpee volume.*
*   **Child's Pose with Side Reach:** 45s/side. Walk hands L/R.
    *Lat/serratus length—counteracts hanging and barbell cycling.*

**4. Debrief (during stretching)**
*   *Downshift breathing:* Slow nasal exhales.
*   *Bright spot examples:* "Clear rep division?" "Transitions smooth?" "Stayed consistent across all 3 parts?"
*   *Tech takeaway:* "Small sets on T2B, no missed reps."
