# PAP vs PAPE — Practical Research Summary

Last updated: 18 January 2026

## Quick definitions
- **PAP (Post-Activation Potentiation):** short-lived increase in muscle twitch force
- **PAPE (Post-Activation Performance Enhancement):** broader, longer-lasting performance
  enhancement driven by increased muscle temperature, activation, and motor-unit
  recruitment.

## Evidence & timing
- Practical PAPE rest window: **3–7 minutes** after a heavy or high-intent stimulus.
- Stimuli that elicit PAPE: heavy near-max strength efforts (≈85–95% 1RM), high-intent
  ballistic movements, or short, high-power clusters.
- Individual responses vary — test 3, 5, 7 min windows to identify athlete peak.

## Practical protocols (strength-focused)

1) Classic Complex Pair
- Heavy: Back Squat 1–3 reps @ 88–92% 1RM (or heavy trap-bar deadlift single)
- Rest: 3–5 min
- Potentiation: Jump Squat or Broad Jump, 3–5 reps × 3 sets (max intent)

2) Cluster / Contrast Block
- Cluster: 3 clusters of 3 reps @ 80–85% 1RM with 20–30s intra-cluster rest
- Post-block rest: 4–6 min
- Follow with speed-focused Hang Cleans 2–3 reps × 3 rounds (light load)

3) Class-Friendly Short-Form
- Build to a heavy double (submax), single set
- Passive rest 3–6 min while athletes do short mobility/activation circuit
- Then 6–8 min high-intent power/skill (EMOM cleans + box jumps)

Programming notes
- Novice athletes: prefer submax loads and plyometrics over true near-max singles.
- Use objective measures (jump height, bar speed) if available; otherwise track
  perceived explosiveness and technique quality.
- Avoid PAPE overload in high-volume weeks — limit heavy potentiation to 1–2 sessions/week.

## Dedicated mobility session (25–40 min)

- Warm-up (RAMP) 6–8 min: light cardio, dynamic ROM, activation.
- Soft-tissue 5–8 min: lacrosse ball on glutes/pecs, thoracic foam work (30–60s/area).
- Positional holds 8–12 min:
  - Banded ankle dorsiflexion 2 × 45–60s/side
  - Couch / hip-flexor 2 × 45–60s/side
  - Loaded deep squat hold (goblet) 3 × 30–45s
  - T-spine rotations + wall slides 2 × 8–10 reps
- Loaded movement flows 6–8 min: 3 × 6–8 slow controlled reps (half-kneeling hinge →
  goblet squat → overhead reach)
- Integration 3–5 min: slow eccentrics or motor-control drills to reinforce range.

Sets/tempo guidance
- Positional holds: 45–60s × 2 sets, controlled breathing
- Movement flows: 6–8 reps, 2–3s eccentric control
- Soft tissue: 30–60s per area; avoid aggressive pain

## Class examples (integration)

- Strength + PAPE + Short Metcon (60–75 min)
  - Warmup 10 min
  - Strength: build to heavy single back squat
  - Rest/PAPE window: 3–5 min (mobility/activation)
  - Potentiation: Jump Squat 3 × 3
  - Metcon: 12-min AMRAP power cleans + row

- Mobility + Skill + Conditioning (60–75 min)
  - Warmup 8 min
  - Mobility block 20 min (from template)
  - Skill/strength 10 min
  - Conditioning 10–12 min EMOM/couplet

## Monitoring & safety
- Test athlete-specific rest windows (3, 5, 7 min) and record results.
- Use objective metrics when available; otherwise use consistent subjective markers.
- Prioritize technique; scale loads for less experienced athletes.

## References & notes
- Practical synthesis based on PAP/PAPE literature and coaching resources.
