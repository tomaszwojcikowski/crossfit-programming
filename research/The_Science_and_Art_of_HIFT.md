# The Science & Art of High-Intensity Functional Training (HIFT)

Last updated: 18 January 2026

## 1. Introduction — The Evolution of the Coach in Functional Fitness

The landscape of modern fitness has shifted toward constantly varied, high-intensity
functional movement. The coach's role now bridges exercise physiology and practical
application. Effective CrossFit coaching is a composite of six capacities: teaching,
seeing, correcting, group management, presence, and demonstration. Mastery of these
domains allows safe guidance of diverse groups while preserving the intended
metabolic stimulus.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Fitness & the Coach’s Mandate

Fitness (CrossFit definition): measurable capacity to perform work (Force × Distance / Time)
across time domains and activities. The coach manipulates training variables to
maximize power output and lifelong health.

### 2.1 The 10 General Physical Skills

| Skill | Definition | Coaching Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Cardiovascular/Respiratory Endurance | Ability to gather, process, and deliver oxygen | Monostructural metabolic conditioning (running, rowing) |
| Stamina | Ability to process, deliver, store, and utilize energy | Volume training; manage local fatigue |
| Strength | Ability of muscular unit(s) to apply force | Mechanics of slow lifts (deadlift, squat, press) |
| Flexibility | Maximize range of motion at a joint | Mobility protocols; ROM standards |
| Power | Apply max force in minimum time | Olympic lifting; cue speed and explosiveness |
| Speed | Minimize time cycle of repeated movement | Sprint drills; cycle efficiency |
| Coordination | Combine distinct movement patterns into one | Complex gymnastics and weightlifting practice |
| Agility | Minimize transition time between movement patterns | Shuttle runs; box drills |
| Balance | Control center of gravity relative to support base | Unilateral work; handstand holds |
| Accuracy | Control movement direction or intensity | Wall balls; box jumps; precise barbell placement |

The first four skills (Endurance, Stamina, Strength, Flexibility) are organic adaptations;
the next four are neurological adaptations developed through practice. Power and Speed
blend both. Coaches must distinguish between "training" (metabolic conditioning) and
"practice" (skill work) when allocating class time.

### 2.2 The Tank Model of Fitness

Visualize the body as a fuel reservoir (ATP). Training depletes, recovery replenishes.
Inflows are metabolic pathways (phosphagen, glycolytic, oxidative); outflows are WODs.
Intensity maximizes return but must match athlete capacity to avoid technique breakdown
or injury.

## 3. Bioenergetics: Coaching the Metabolic Pathways

Different workouts target different energy systems; scaling must preserve intended
metabolic stimulus.

### 3.1 The Three Engines

- **Phosphagen (ATP-CP)** — Dominant <10s. High power, short duration. Rest long (e.g., 1:10).
- **Glycolytic (Lactate)** — Dominant ~30s–2min. Moderate power/duration; produces lactate. Coach role: psychological support and scaling to maintain movement.
- **Oxidative (Aerobic)** — Dominant >2min. Low power, long duration. Coach role: pacing, breathing, efficiency.

### 3.2 Preserving Stimulus Through Scaling

If an athlete's weakness turns a glycolytic sprint into a long-duration effort, the
stimulus changes. Preserve intent via:

- Load: reduce weight to permit large, unbroken sets.
- Volume: reduce reps to keep the time domain (e.g., 21→15→9).
- Complexity: substitute biomechanically similar movements (jumping pull-up for strict).

## 4. Motor Learning & Instruction

Effective coaching is teaching. Leverage motor learning principles and favor external
focus cues over internal focus to promote automaticity and performance.

### 4.1 Attentional Focus: Internal vs External

The Constrained Action Hypothesis: internal focus can interfere with automatic motor
control; external focus promotes automaticity and better outcomes.

Examples of external cues:

- Deadlift: "Squeeze oranges in your armpits."
- Squat: "Spread the floor with your feet."
- Clean: "Jump the bar to the ceiling."
- Push press: "Throw the bar through the roof."
- Box jump: "Land soft like a ninja."

### 4.2 Tell — Show — Do — Check Pedagogy

- Tell: ≤10s concise explanation.
- Show: visual demonstration (coach or demonstrator).
- Do: athlete practices.
- Check: coach observes and corrects.

Layer complexity only as competence increases (e.g., snatch: stance → grip → first pull → turnover).

## 5. The Art of Seeing: Visual Mechanics & Triage

"Seeing" = discerning movement faults quickly. Use macro (global) and micro (local)
scanning strategies.

### 5.1 Macro vs Micro Scanning

- Macro: scan whole class for safety/organization.
- Micro: focus 1–3 reps on an individual to analyze dynamic faults.

Use the 1-1-1 strategy: See one athlete → Correct one athlete → Scan the room → Move on.

### 5.2 Hierarchy of Triage

Prioritize faults:

1. Safety — STOP, reduce load or stop the athlete (e.g., lumbar rounding).
2. Function — FIX while moving (energy leaks, technical errors).
3. Optimization — REFINE after the set or session.

## 6. Correcting: Cueing Strategies

Three cue modalities: verbal (short), visual (coach demonstration), tactile (with permission).
Use the Sandwich Method: Praise → Correction → Praise.

## 7. Class Architecture: Lesson Planning & Logistics

A 60-minute class functions like a project timeline. Time allocation example:

- 0:00–0:03 — Whiteboard brief (why, flow, scaling, injury subs).
- 0:03–0:12 — General warm-up (RAMP).
- 0:12–0:25 — Specific warm-up / skill (Tell/Show/Do/Check).
- 0:25–0:35 — Build-up & logistics (load selection, equipment setup).
- 0:38–0:50 — WOD (scan, motivate, enforce standards).
- 0:50–1:00 — Cooldown & debrief (mobility, bright spots, logging).

### 7.1 Whiteboard Brief Essentials

Include stimulus, flow, scaling (A/B/C) and injury substitutions. Keep it concise.

### 7.2 Group Management

- Line of sight: coach on perimeter for best view.
- Single start: preserve group cohesion; manage equipment limits with substitutions,
  shared stations, or adjusted reps so everyone starts together.
- Equipment layout: minimize transit and collisions.

## 8. Psychology, Community & Retention

Coaching builds community. Psychological safety and positive reinforcement drive
retention. Use the "Bright Spots" strategy: ask athletes to share one thing they did
well at the end of class.

### 8.1 WOOP Goal Setting

Guide athletes through WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) to build meaningful,
actionable goals and increase long-term engagement.

## 9. Professionalism & Virtuosity

Pursue continuing education, film and review coaching, solicit peer feedback, and
model the standards you expect from athletes.

## 10. Conclusion

Great coaching is science plus empathetic leadership: preserve metabolic intent,
apply motor learning principles, triage faults for safety, and create psychological
safety to support sustained engagement and improvement.
