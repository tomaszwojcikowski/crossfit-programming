RAMP — Annotated Meta-Analysis Summary (2015–2025)

Purpose: concise annotations (abstract snippets + 2–3 practical takeaways) for key meta-analyses and systematic reviews on warm-ups, stretching, and post-activation potentiation (PAP/PAPE).

1) Seitz LB, Haff GG. Factors modulating post-activation potentiation of jump, sprint, throw, and upper-body ballistic performances: systematic review with meta-analysis. Sports Med. 2016. DOI: 10.1007/s40279-015-0415-7
- Abstract (short): Reviewed PAP literature; effects depend on conditioning activity, athlete strength/training status, and timing/rest intervals.
- Takeaways:
  - Stronger/trained athletes show larger PAP effects.
  - Use dynamic, movement-specific conditioning; individualize rest (commonly 3–7 min window).
  - Report load/volume/rest to reproduce effects.

2) Dobbs WC, Tolusso DV, Fedewa MV, Esco MR. Effect of postactivation potentiation on explosive vertical jump: systematic review and meta-analysis. J Strength Cond Res. 2019. DOI: 10.1519/JSC.0000000000002750
- Abstract (short): Pooled 179 effects from 36 studies; overall trivial mean effect, but dynamic stimuli with 3–7 min rest gave small positive gains; short (<3 min) or isometric protocols often detrimental.
- Takeaways:
  - If using heavy loads (≥80% 1RM), allow ~3–7 min before testing/explosive effort.
  - Prefer dynamic conditioning over isometric contractions for jump outcomes.
  - Expect modest, variable improvements; protocol tuning is essential.

3) Xu K, Blazevich AJ, Boullosa D, Ramírez‑Campillo R, et al. Optimizing post-activation performance enhancement in athletic tasks: systematic review with meta-analysis for prescription variables and research methods. Sports Med. 2024/2025. DOI: 10.1007/s40279-024-02170-6
- Abstract (short): Updated synthesis focusing on prescription variables (load, sets, reps, rest, contraction type) and methodological recommendations.
- Takeaways:
  - PAPE outcomes are highly protocol-dependent; individualize by strength and task.
  - Researchers and coaches should standardize reporting of stimulus and timing.
  - Consider lower-volume explosive priming for less-trained athletes.

4) Li J, Soh KG, Loh SP. The impact of post-activation potentiation on explosive vertical jump after intermittent time: a meta-analysis and systematic review. Sci Rep. 2024. DOI: 10.1038/s41598-024-67995-7
- Abstract (short): Examined timing/rest windows for PAPE effects on vertical jump; timing is a strong determinant of observed benefits.
- Takeaways:
  - Optimal timing windows exist but vary across studies; monitor athlete response.
  - Use small pilot tests to find each athlete's best rest interval.

5) Zhao C, Li C, Su R, Chen L, Wei W, et al. Comparison of different methods on post-activation performance enhancement: a meta-analysis. Int J Sports Med. 2025. DOI: 10.1055/a-2464-3148
- Abstract (short): Compared BFR-RT vs high-load RT for PAPE; both improved jump/power with some population-specific differences.
- Takeaways:
  - Alternative methods (e.g., blood-flow-restriction protocols) can induce PAPE in some athletes.
  - Choose method by equipment, training status, and safety considerations.

6) Arntz F, Behm DG, et al. Effects of static stretching exercises on muscle strength and power: systematic review with multi-level meta-analysis. Sports Med. 2022. DOI: 10.1007/s40279-022-01806-9
- Abstract (short): Acute long-duration static stretching can impair immediate strength/power; short-duration/static in warm-ups has negligible effects; chronic stretching yields small benefits for flexibility and small/neutral effects for strength.
- Takeaways:
  - Avoid long static holds immediately before maximal-power tasks.
  - Use brief mobility and dynamic movement instead during warm-ups.

7) Thomas E, Ficarra S, Nunes JP, Paoli A, et al. Does stretching training influence muscular strength? Systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression. J Strength Cond Res. 2023. DOI: 10.1519/JSC.0000000000004400
- Abstract (short): Chronic stretching programs produced small improvements in dynamic strength; stretching immediately before RT may blunt gains.
- Takeaways:
  - Schedule stretching away from heavy strength sessions when possible.
  - Chronic, consistent mobility work can modestly aid dynamic strength.

8) Ingram LA, Tomkinson GR, et al. Optimising the dose of static stretching to improve flexibility: systematic review, meta-analysis and multivariate meta-regression. Sports Med. 2024. DOI: 10.1007/s40279-024-02143-9
- Abstract (short): Identified effective stretch durations/frequencies for flexibility gains and practical dosing guidance.
- Takeaways:
  - Use targeted, time-limited stretching protocols for ROM goals, not as prolonged pre-exercise holds.

9) Warneke K, Lohmann LH, Behm DG, et al. Effects of chronic static stretching interventions on jumping and sprinting performance – a systematic review with multilevel meta-analysis. Front Physiol. 2024.
- Abstract (short): Chronic static stretching has mixed, mostly neutral-to-small effects on sprint/jump performance.
- Takeaways:
  - Chronic stretching is neither strongly harmful nor clearly beneficial for sprint/jump metrics; contextualize for athlete goals.
