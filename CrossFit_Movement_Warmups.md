# CrossFit Movement Warmup Routines

## Evidence-Based Preparation for High-Performance Training

---

## The Science Behind This Document

This warmup guide is built on the **RAMP protocol** (Raise, Activate, Mobilize, Potentiate) developed by Ian Jeffreys, combined with practical coaching experience from CrossFit methodology.

### Why 3 Rounds of 3 Exercises?

**Research basis:**
- **Tissue temperature**: A 1-2°C increase in muscle temperature improves contractile efficiency and reduces injury risk (Bishop, 2003). This requires 5-10 minutes of progressive activity.
- **Neural priming**: Post-Activation Potentiation (PAP) shows that performing movement patterns at increasing intensities enhances subsequent force production for 3-10 minutes (Tillin & Bishop, 2009).
- **Dynamic vs. static stretching**: Dynamic movement maintains neural drive and power output, while pre-workout static stretching can reduce force production by 5-8% (Behm & Chaouachi, 2011).

**Coaching rationale:**
- Round 1 = **Raise** (blood flow, tissue temperature, joint lubrication)
- Round 2 = **Activate + Mobilize** (muscle recruitment, dynamic ROM)
- Round 3 = **Potentiate** (movement-specific priming at higher intensity)

### Equipment Philosophy

- **Cardio options**: Rotate between machines (row/bike/ski), running, jump rope, shuttle runs, and locomotion drills. Variety prevents staleness and develops broader conditioning.
- **Max 1 extra item**: Reduces transition time and keeps athletes focused. Equipment should serve the movement pattern being prepared.

### How to Run Each Warmup

1. **Round 1 -> Round 2 -> Round 3** (complete all 3 stations per round before advancing)
2. **Rest 30-60s** between rounds (use this time for coaching cues or athlete questions)
3. **Total time**: 8-12 minutes per warmup
4. **Intensity check**: Athletes should be warm and slightly sweaty, but NOT fatigued

## Warmup Protocols by Movement

---

## 1. Clean & Jerk

**Equipment:** Machine only

**Why this works:** The clean & jerk demands hip power, front rack mobility, and fast elbow turnover. This warmup progressively opens the hips, activates the posterior chain, and primes the dip-drive pattern without loading the spine.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Row 2:00 easy | Glute bridge x 12 | Squat-to-stand x 6 |
| Round 2 | Row 1:30 moderate | Tall plank shoulder taps x 20 | Split-stance dip + drive (no weight) x 8 |
| Round 3 | Row 1:00 hard | Jump squat x 6 | Fast elbows in place (front rack drill) x 10 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Glute bridge: "Squeeze at top, don't hyperextend the back"
- Split-stance dip: "Vertical torso, fast drive through the floor"
- Fast elbows: "Elbows whip around, not up - think speed, not strength"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Front rack stretch on rig x 30s/side (elbows high, lean forward)
- Couch stretch x 30s/side (hip flexor opening for split jerk)
- Thoracic rotation on floor x 5/side (open receiving position)

**Movement Prep (with empty barbell):**
1. Muscle clean x 5 (slow, feel the turnover)
2. Front squat x 5 (establish rack position)
3. Hang power clean x 3 (add hip pop)
4. Push press x 5 (dip-drive pattern)
5. Push jerk x 3 (add the catch)
6. Full clean + jerk x 2-3 (put it together)

---

## 2. Rope Climb

**Equipment:** Machine + Rope (1 extra)

**Why this works:** Rope climbing is grip-intensive and requires lat engagement with core stability. The warmup progressively loads the forearms and teaches the foot clamp pattern before climbing.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Jog 200m | Rope pull-downs (standing) x 10 | Wrist circles x 10 each way |
| Round 2 | Run 200m (moderate) | Rope pull-downs x 12 | Hollow hold 20s |
| Round 3 | Run 100m (fast) | Rope foot clamp practice x 6 | Rope pull-downs (fast) x 8 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Pull-downs: "Pull rope to chest, squeeze lats at bottom"
- Foot clamp: "J-hook wrap - scoop, clamp, stand. Practice the pattern before climbing"
- Hollow hold: "Ribs down, lower back glued to floor"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Lat stretch on rig x 30s/side (hang, shift hips away from arm)
- Wrist flexor/extensor stretch x 20s each direction
- Thread the needle x 5/side (thoracic rotation for reaching)

**Movement Prep:**
1. Seated foot clamp practice x 5/side (perfect the J-hook)
2. Standing rope pulls - pull to chest, lower controlled x 6
3. Jump + hang on rope x 3 (get used to rope in hands)
4. One foot clamp + stand x 3 (partial climb pattern)
5. Low rope climb to 2m and back x 1-2

---

## 3. Double Unders

**Equipment:** Machine + Jump rope (1 extra)

**Why this works:** Double unders are a neurological skill - the brain must dissociate wrist speed from jump cadence. The Penguin tap drill (developed by jump rope coaches) programs the "tap-tap" timing at the apex of the jump.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Jumping jacks x 40 | Pogo hops x 20 | Single unders x 30 |
| Round 2 | Jumping jacks x 30 (fast) | Penguin taps x 10 | High single unders x 25 |
| Round 3 | High knees x 20 | Single-single-double attempts x 10 | Unbroken double unders x 10-30 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Pogo hops: "Straight legs, bounce from ankles - not knees"
- Penguin taps: "Jump, tap thighs twice at the TOP of the jump"
- Single-single-double: "Two slow, one fast - feel the rhythm change"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Calf stretch on wall x 30s/side (straight leg, heel down)
- Ankle circles x 10 each direction/side
- Wrist circles with fingers interlaced x 10 each direction

**Movement Prep:**
1. Single unders x 20 (find your rhythm)
2. Power jumps (no rope, max height) x 5
3. Single unders with double tap on thighs x 10
4. Single-single-double x 10 attempts
5. Continuous double unders x 10-20 (or max unbroken)

---

## 4. Wall Balls

**Equipment:** Machine + Medicine ball (1 extra)

**Why this works:** Wall balls combine a front squat with a push-press. The warmup establishes the squat pattern first, then adds the ball to practice the catch-squat-throw cycle.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Shuttle run 4x10m | Air squat x 12 | Med-ball front squat (light) x 8 |
| Round 2 | Shuttle run 4x10m (faster) | Reverse lunge x 10 (alt) | Med-ball thruster (light) x 6 |
| Round 3 | Shuttle run 2x10m (sprint) | Air squat x 10 (fast) | Wall balls (light/working) x 8-12 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Med-ball squat: "Ball at chest, elbows up - same position as barbell front squat"
- Thruster: "Hip drive throws the ball, arms just guide"
- Wall balls: "Catch, absorb into squat, drive up. Don't pause at the top"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Deep squat hold with elbows pushing knees out x 30s
- Hip flexor stretch (half-kneeling) x 30s/side
- Ankle dorsiflexion stretch (knee to wall) x 30s/side

**Movement Prep (with working weight ball):**
1. Med-ball front squat x 5 (establish ball position)
2. Med-ball push press x 5 (no squat, just throw)
3. Slow wall balls x 5 (catch, pause in squat, drive up)
4. Wall balls at 50% pace x 5-8
5. Wall balls at workout pace x 5-8

## 5. Kettlebell Swings (American)

**Equipment:** Machine + Kettlebell (1 extra)

**Why this works:** KB swings are hip-dominant - the power comes from the hip hinge, not the arms. Russian swings (eye level) establish the pattern before progressing to American (overhead).

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Bike 2:00 easy | Hip hinge to reach (no weight) x 10 | KB deadlift x 10 |
| Round 2 | Bike 1:30 moderate | Glute bridge x 12 | Russian KB swings (light) x 10 |
| Round 3 | Bike 1:00 hard | Plank hold 20s | American KB swings (light) x 8 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Hip hinge: "Push hips BACK, not down - feel hamstrings stretch"
- Russian swing: "Snap hips, bell floats to eye level. Arms are ropes"
- American swing: "Same hip snap - just let momentum carry bell overhead. Squeeze glutes at top"

**Common fault:** "Squatting the swing" - knees bend too much, torso stays upright. Fix: emphasize hip hinge pattern in Round 1.

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Standing hamstring stretch (foot on box) x 30s/side
- Hip flexor stretch (half-kneeling) x 30s/side
- Thoracic extension over foam roller x 30s (arms overhead)

**Movement Prep (with working weight KB):**
1. KB deadlift x 5 (hinge pattern)
2. KB deadlift + shrug x 5 (add power)
3. Russian swings x 8 (eye level)
4. American swings x 5 (full overhead)
5. American swings at workout pace x 8-10

---

## 6. Box Jumps

**Equipment:** Machine + Box (1 extra)

**Why this works:** Box jumps are plyometric - they rely on the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) of tendons. Step-downs protect the Achilles tendon, which is vulnerable to high-rep rebounding (especially in masters athletes).

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Skip 100m | Pogo hops x 20 | Step-ups to box x 10 (alt) |
| Round 2 | Skip 100m (higher knees) | Air squat x 12 | Low box jumps x 6 (step down) |
| Round 3 | Bounding x 10 | Broad jumps x 5 | Box jumps (work height) x 5 (step down) |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Pogo hops: "Ankles only - prep the tendons for impact"
- Low box: "Land soft, full hip extension on top, step down"
- Work height: "Jump THROUGH the box, not TO the edge. Aim for the middle"

**Safety note:** Step-down is mandatory in warmup. Rebounding is advanced and requires conditioned connective tissue.

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Calf stretch on box edge x 30s/side (heel drops)
- Hip flexor stretch (half-kneeling) x 30s/side
- Ankle dorsiflexion (knee to wall) x 30s/side

**Movement Prep (at working height):**
1. Step-ups x 5/leg (establish height comfort)
2. Box jump + controlled step-down x 3
3. Box jump + soft land, hold 2s x 3
4. Box jumps at 50% pace x 5
5. Box jumps at workout pace x 5

## 7. Burpees

**Equipment:** Machine only

**Why this works:** Burpees are full-body metabolic movements. The warmup progresses from controlled walk-outs (teaching the plank position) to fast burpees.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Jog 200m | Walk-out to plank x 6 | Slow burpees x 5 |
| Round 2 | Run 200m (moderate) | Mountain climbers x 20 | Burpees x 6 |
| Round 3 | Run 100m (fast) | Burpees x 8 | Fast feet in place x 20s |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Walk-out: "Hands walk out, hold plank 2s, walk back. Control the core"
- Slow burpees: "Chest to floor, stand all the way up. Quality over speed"
- Fast burpees: "Worm up (chest-hips-knees), snap feet forward, jump"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Wrist flexor stretch (fingers back, palms down) x 20s
- Hip flexor stretch (half-kneeling) x 30s/side
- Cobra stretch x 20s (open chest, prep for floor contact)

**Movement Prep:**
1. Walk-out to plank + walk back x 3
2. Burpee - slow descent, controlled stand x 3
3. Burpee - normal pace x 5
4. Burpee - fast pace x 5
5. Burpees at workout pace x 5-8

---

## 8. Dumbbell Snatch

**Equipment:** Machine + Dumbbell (1 extra)

**Why this works:** The DB snatch is unilateral - it exposes asymmetries and demands rotational stability. The warmup builds from deadlift (hinge pattern) to high pull (power transfer) to full snatch.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Single unders x 50 | DB deadlift x 8 | Dead bug x 8 (alt) |
| Round 2 | Single unders x 40 (fast) | DB hang high pull x 6/arm | Reverse lunge x 10 (alt) |
| Round 3 | High knees x 20 | DB power snatch x 4/arm | DB alternating snatch x 10 total |

**Coach's Cues:**
- DB deadlift: "Neutral spine, drive through heels"
- High pull: "Explosive hip, elbow high - don't muscle it"
- Snatch: "Close to body, punch overhead. Lock out by the ear, not out front"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Shoulder pass-throughs with PVC x 10 (slow, controlled)
- Thoracic rotation (open book) x 5/side
- Hip flexor stretch (half-kneeling + reach overhead) x 30s/side

**Movement Prep (with working weight DB):**
1. DB deadlift x 5 (one arm, hinge pattern)
2. DB hang high pull x 5/arm
3. DB hang power snatch x 3/arm
4. DB power snatch from floor x 3/arm
5. Alternating DB snatch x 10 total (workout pace)

---

## 9. Snatch (Olympic)

**Equipment:** Machine only

**Why this works:** The snatch demands shoulder mobility, hip power, and fast turnover. This bodyweight-only warmup opens the overhead position and primes the triple extension pattern.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Ski erg 2:00 easy | Squat-to-stand x 6 | Arm circles x 10 each way |
| Round 2 | Ski erg 1:30 moderate | Overhead reach + shrug (no weight) x 10 | Lunge + rotation x 6 (alt) |
| Round 3 | Ski erg 1:00 hard | Jump shrug (no weight) x 6 | Drop-to-squat (fast down, controlled up) x 6 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Squat-to-stand: "Grab toes, straighten legs, drop into squat. Opens hamstrings and hips"
- Jump shrug: "Triple extension - ankles, knees, hips. Shrug at the top"
- Drop-to-squat: "Fast down, catch in bottom, stand controlled. Mimics receiving position"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Overhead squat hold with PVC x 30s (active shoulders, full depth)
- Lat stretch on rig x 30s/side
- Banded shoulder distraction x 30s/side (external rotation)

**Movement Prep (with empty barbell):**
1. Snatch grip press behind neck x 5
2. Overhead squat x 5 (establish receiving position)
3. Snatch grip deadlift x 5 (feel the pull)
4. Hang power snatch x 3
5. Power snatch from floor x 3
6. Full snatch x 2-3 (if doing squat snatch)

---

## 10. Pull-ups / Muscle-ups

**Equipment:** Machine + Pull-up bar (1 extra)

**Why this works:** Pull-ups require scapular control and lat engagement. Scapular pull-ups isolate the "shoulders down and back" position that protects the shoulder joint under load.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Bear crawl 20m + jog back | Dead hang 20s | Scapular pull-ups x 8 |
| Round 2 | Crab walk 20m + jog back | Hollow hold 20s | Strict pull-ups x 3-5 |
| Round 3 | Inchworm walk x 6 | Kip swings x 8 | Chest-to-bar pull-ups x 3-5 (or strict) |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Dead hang: "Relax shoulders, let lats stretch. Grip work"
- Scapular pull-ups: "No elbow bend - just pull shoulder blades DOWN. Small range, big activation"
- Kip swings: "Tight arch, tight hollow. Control the swing before adding pull"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Lat stretch on rig x 30s/side (hang, shift hips away)
- Banded shoulder distraction x 30s/side
- Thoracic extension over foam roller x 30s

**Movement Prep:**
1. Scapular pull-ups x 8 (shoulder activation)
2. Kip swings x 8 (tight arch-hollow)
3. Strict pull-ups x 3-5 (or banded)
4. Kipping pull-ups x 5
5. Chest-to-bar or muscle-up progressions x 3-5 (if applicable)

---

## 11. Toes-to-Bar (TTB)

**Equipment:** Machine + Pull-up bar (1 extra)

**Why this works:** TTB requires core compression (hip flexion) combined with the kipping rhythm. The warmup builds hollow body control, then kip timing, then full TTB.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Jog 200m | Dead hang 20s | Hollow hold 20s |
| Round 2 | High knees 30s + butt kicks 30s | Kip swings x 8 | Knees-to-chest x 6 |
| Round 3 | Run 100m (fast) | Toes-to-bar singles x 3-6 | Kip swings x 6 (tight, controlled) |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Hollow hold: "Ribs DOWN, lower back pressed to floor. This is your TTB position"
- Knees-to-chest: "Kip into it - use the swing, not just abs"
- TTB singles: "Big kip, toes touch, reset. Don't rush the rhythm"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Lat stretch on rig x 30s/side
- Pike stretch (seated, reach to toes) x 30s
- Hip flexor stretch (half-kneeling) x 30s/side

**Movement Prep:**
1. Scapular pull-ups x 6
2. Kip swings x 8 (big, controlled)
3. Knees-to-chest x 5
4. Knees-to-elbows x 3
5. Toes-to-bar singles x 5 (reset between each)
6. Toes-to-bar x 3-5 linked (if able)

---

## 12. Handstand Push-ups (HSPU)

**Equipment:** Machine + Wall (1 extra)

**Why this works:** HSPUs demand overhead pressing strength in an inverted position. The warmup builds shoulder stability progressively - pike position, then wall support, then pressing.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Shuttle run 4x10m | Downward dog 20s | Pike push-ups x 8 |
| Round 2 | Shuttle run 4x10m (faster) | Wall-facing handstand hold 15-25s | Shoulder taps in plank x 20 |
| Round 3 | Shuttle run 2x10m (sprint) | Wall-facing handstand hold 15-25s | Strict HSPU (or 1-2 negatives) x 2-5 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Downward dog: "Push floor away, shoulders open, heels reaching down"
- Wall HS hold: "Belly to wall, squeeze glutes, ribs IN. Don't arch"
- HSPU negatives: "Slow descent (3-5s), control to the mat"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Wall angels x 10 (slow, full ROM)
- Wrist flexor/extensor stretch x 20s each direction
- Thoracic extension on foam roller x 30s (arms overhead)

**Movement Prep:**
1. Pike push-ups x 5 (elevated feet if needed)
2. Wall walk to handstand x 2
3. Wall-facing handstand hold x 20s
4. HSPU negative (slow descent 5s) x 2
5. Strict HSPU x 3-5 (or kipping if strict is established)

---

## 13. Deadlifts

**Equipment:** Machine only

**Why this works:** Deadlifts are hip-hinge dominant. The warmup pattern-grooves the hinge, activates the posterior chain, and prepares the spine for loading.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Bike 2:00 easy | Hip hinge to reach x 10 | Glute bridge x 12 |
| Round 2 | Bike 1:30 moderate | Good-morning (no weight) x 10 | Bird-dog x 8 (alt) |
| Round 3 | Bike 1:00 hard | Broad jumps x 5 | Hip hinge + pause at knee x 8 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Hip hinge: "Butt goes BACK, not down. Feel hamstrings load"
- Good-morning: "Slight knee bend, hinge until tension, stand tall"
- Pause at knee: "This is your first pull position. Lats tight, back flat"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Standing hamstring stretch (foot elevated) x 30s/side
- Hip flexor stretch (half-kneeling) x 30s/side
- Cat-cow x 8 (spinal articulation)

**Movement Prep (with empty barbell):**
1. RDL (Romanian deadlift) x 8 (hinge pattern, bar stays close)
2. Deadlift - pause at knee x 5 (feel the pull position)
3. Deadlift x 5 @ empty bar
4. Deadlift x 5 @ 40%
5. Deadlift x 3 @ 60%
6. Build to working weight in singles or doubles

---

## 14. Back Squat

**Equipment:** Machine only

**Why this works:** Back squats require hip/ankle mobility and core stability. The warmup addresses all three planes of motion to open the hips fully.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Single unders x 50 | Air squat x 12 | Squat-to-stand x 6 |
| Round 2 | Single unders x 40 (fast) | Reverse lunge x 10 (alt) | Lateral lunge x 8 (alt) |
| Round 3 | Double unders x 20 (or high SU) | Jump squat x 6 | Air squat x 10 (fast) |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Air squat: "Knees track toes, chest up, full depth"
- Lateral lunge: "Sit into the working hip, keep other leg straight"
- Jump squat: "Fast down, explosive up. Land soft, repeat"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Deep squat hold x 30s (elbows push knees out)
- Ankle dorsiflexion (knee to wall) x 30s/side
- Hip 90/90 stretch x 30s/side

**Movement Prep (with empty barbell):**
1. Back squat x 8 @ empty bar (establish position)
2. Pause squat (3s bottom) x 3 @ empty bar
3. Back squat x 5 @ 40%
4. Back squat x 3 @ 60%
5. Build to working weight in doubles or singles

---

## 15. Thruster

**Equipment:** Machine only

**Why this works:** Thrusters combine front squat + push press. The warmup builds the squat-to-overhead transfer pattern using bodyweight.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Jog 200m | Air squat x 10 | Squat + overhead reach x 10 |
| Round 2 | Run 200m (moderate) | Push-up x 8 | Squat + fast hands overhead x 10 |
| Round 3 | Run 100m (fast) | Burpees x 6 | Squat jump + reach x 6 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Squat + reach: "Drive out of the squat, reach at the top. One smooth movement"
- Fast hands: "Speed the transition - hips drive, hands follow"
- Squat jump + reach: "Explosive hip extension carries you up"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Front rack stretch on rig x 30s/side
- Deep squat hold x 30s (elbows push knees out)
- Hip flexor stretch (half-kneeling) x 30s/side

**Movement Prep (with empty barbell):**
1. Front squat x 5 (establish rack position)
2. Push press x 5 (feel the dip-drive)
3. Thruster - slow x 5 (pause in bottom)
4. Thruster x 5 @ empty bar (fluid)
5. Thruster x 5 @ 40-50% (or workout weight)

---

## 16. Ring Dips

**Equipment:** Machine + Rings (1 extra)

**Why this works:** Ring dips demand shoulder stability in an unstable environment. The support hold teaches the "turned out" (externally rotated) position that protects the shoulder.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Jumping jacks x 40 | Ring support hold 15-25s | Scapular push-ups x 10 |
| Round 2 | Seal jacks x 30 | Ring support hold 15-25s | Slow ring dip negatives x 3 |
| Round 3 | Mountain climbers x 20 | Ring dips x 3-6 | Push-ups x 10 (fast but clean) |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Support hold: "Turn rings OUT, squeeze armpits, stay tight"
- Negatives: "3-5 second descent, control the wobble"
- Ring dips: "Full lockout at top, break parallel at bottom"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Doorway chest stretch x 30s/side (elbow at 90°)
- Banded shoulder distraction x 30s/side (internal rotation)
- Wrist flexor stretch x 20s (for ring support)

**Movement Prep:**
1. Ring support hold x 15s (rings turned out)
2. Ring support with small dips x 5 (quarter range)
3. Ring dip negative (5s descent) x 3
4. Ring dips x 3-5 (full ROM)
5. Ring dips at workout pace x 5

---

## 17. Front Squat

**Equipment:** Machine only

**Why this works:** Front squats demand upright torso and front rack mobility. The warmup emphasizes the "elbows up" position that keeps the torso vertical.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Ski erg 2:00 easy | Air squat x 12 | Squat-to-stand x 6 |
| Round 2 | Ski erg 1:30 moderate | Pause squat (2s bottom) x 6 | Tall plank shoulder taps x 20 |
| Round 3 | Ski erg 1:00 hard | Jump squat x 6 | Air squat x 10 (upright torso focus) |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Pause squat: "2 seconds in the hole - fight to stay upright"
- Upright focus: "Chest to the wall in front of you, not the floor"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Front rack stretch on rig x 30s/side (elbows HIGH)
- Ankle dorsiflexion (knee to wall) x 30s/side
- Thoracic extension on foam roller x 30s

**Movement Prep (with empty barbell):**
1. Front squat x 8 @ empty bar (elbows high focus)
2. Pause front squat (3s bottom) x 3
3. Front squat x 5 @ 40%
4. Front squat x 3 @ 60%
5. Build to working weight in doubles or singles

---

## 18. Strict Press (Overhead Press)

**Equipment:** Machine only

**Why this works:** Strict press is pure vertical pressing - no leg drive. The warmup activates the shoulders and teaches midline stability under overhead load.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Bear crawl 20m + walk back | Arm circles x 10 each way | Pike push-ups x 8 |
| Round 2 | Inchworm walk x 6 | Plank hold 20s | Hand-release push-ups x 6 |
| Round 3 | Mountain climbers x 20 | Shoulder taps in plank x 20 | Fast hands overhead reach x 12 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Pike push-ups: "Hips high, head between arms, press vertical"
- Hand-release: "Full chest to floor, hands off, press back up"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Wall angels x 10 (slow, shoulder blades on wall)
- Lat stretch on rig x 30s/side
- Thoracic rotation (open book) x 5/side

**Movement Prep (with empty barbell):**
1. Strict press x 8 @ empty bar

## 19. Rows (Bent-Over Pattern)

**Equipment:** Machine + Rings (1 extra)

**Why this works:** Rows train horizontal pulling - the antagonist to pressing. Ring rows allow scalable intensity based on body angle.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Jog 200m | Ring rows x 8 | Cat-cow x 8 |
| Round 2 | Run 200m (moderate) | Ring rows x 10 | Prone Y-raises x 10 |
| Round 3 | Run 100m (fast) | Ring rows x 8 (fast) | Hollow hold 20s |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Ring rows: "Squeeze shoulder blades together, pull to chest"
- Y-raises: "Thumbs up, lift from upper back, not lower back"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Thoracic rotation (open book) x 5/side
- Cat-cow x 8 (spinal articulation)
- Lat stretch on rig x 30s/side

**Movement Prep (with empty barbell or rings):**
1. Ring rows x 8 (moderate angle)
2. Ring rows x 8 (steeper angle)
3. Bent-over row x 8 @ empty bar (squeeze at top)
4. Bent-over row x 5 @ 40%
5. Build to working weight

## 20. Medicine Ball Cleans

**Equipment:** Machine + Medicine ball (1 extra)

**Why this works:** Med-ball cleans teach the "catch in the squat" pattern. They're excellent for beginners learning Olympic lifting mechanics.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Shuttle run 4x10m | Air squat x 10 | Med-ball deadlift (to mid-shin) x 8 |
| Round 2 | Shuttle run 4x10m (faster) | Med-ball front squat x 8 | Reverse lunge x 10 (alt) |
| Round 3 | Shuttle run 2x10m (sprint) | Med-ball clean x 6 | Med-ball clean (fast) x 6 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- MB deadlift: "Flat back, drive through heels"
- MB clean: "Explosive hips, catch in the squat - not on the way down"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Deep squat hold x 30s (elbows push knees out)
- Hip flexor stretch (half-kneeling) x 30s/side
- Ankle dorsiflexion (knee to wall) x 30s/side

**Movement Prep (with working weight ball):**
1. Med-ball deadlift x 5 (hinge pattern)
2. Med-ball front squat x 5 (ball at chest)
3. Med-ball clean - slow x 5 (feel the catch)
4. Med-ball clean x 8 (fluid)
5. Med-ball clean at workout pace x 8-10

## 21. Push Press

**Equipment:** Machine only

**Why this works:** Push press uses leg drive to move weight overhead. The warmup teaches the dip-drive pattern without load.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Bike 2:00 easy | Squat + overhead reach x 10 | Arm circles x 10 each way |
| Round 2 | Bike 1:30 moderate | Dip + drive to reach (no weight) x 10 | Plank hold 20s |
| Round 3 | Bike 1:00 hard | Dip + drive to reach (fast) x 8 | Burpees x 5 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Dip + drive: "Small dip (quarter squat), violent drive. Heels stay down in dip"
- Fast version: "Quick dip, explosive up. The dip is where the power comes from"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Shoulder pass-throughs with PVC x 10
- Hip flexor stretch (half-kneeling) x 30s/side
- Thoracic extension on foam roller x 30s

**Movement Prep (with empty barbell):**
1. Strict press x 5 (establish overhead position)
2. Dip only x 5 (feel the quarter squat, vertical torso)
3. Push press x 5 @ empty bar
4. Push press x 5 @ 40%
5. Push press x 3 @ 60%
6. Build to working weight

## 22. Turkish Get-ups (TGU)

**Equipment:** Machine + Kettlebell (1 extra)

**Why this works:** TGU is a complex, multi-planar movement. The warmup breaks it into phases - floor work, then transitions.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Jumping jacks x 40 | Dead bug x 8 (alt) | KB halos x 8 each way |
| Round 2 | Seal jacks x 30 | Glute bridge x 12 | Get-up to elbow (KB or no weight) x 3/side |
| Round 3 | High knees x 20 | KB suitcase march (in place) 20 steps | Get-up to tall sit x 2-3/side |

**Coach's Cues:**
- KB halos: "Eyes forward, circle the head. Shoulder mobility"
- Get-up to elbow: "Press up, then roll to elbow. One step at a time"
- Tall sit: "From elbow to hand, lift hips, thread leg. Controlled"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Shoulder pass-throughs with PVC x 10
- Hip 90/90 stretch x 30s/side
- Thoracic rotation (open book) x 5/side

**Movement Prep (start light, progress to working weight):**
1. TGU to elbow x 2/side (no weight or light KB)
2. TGU to tall sit x 2/side
3. TGU to high bridge x 2/side
4. Full TGU x 1/side @ light weight
5. Full TGU x 1/side @ working weight

## 23. Lateral Jumps / Broad Jumps

**Equipment:** Machine only

**Why this works:** Lateral and broad jumps develop multi-directional power. The warmup builds from low-amplitude hops to max-effort jumps.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Skip 100m | Pogo hops x 20 | Lateral lunge x 8 (alt) |
| Round 2 | Lateral shuffle 20m (each way) | Lateral jumps (small) x 10 | Broad jumps (controlled) x 4 |
| Round 3 | Carioca 20m (each way) | Lateral jumps x 12 | Broad jumps x 5 |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Lateral jumps: "Push off one leg, land soft on both. Stay athletic"
- Broad jumps: "Arm swing back, explode forward, stick the landing"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Adductor stretch (Cossack squat hold) x 30s/side
- Hip flexor stretch (half-kneeling) x 30s/side
- Ankle dorsiflexion (knee to wall) x 30s/side

**Movement Prep:**
1. Lateral shuffles 10m each way x 2
2. Small lateral hops x 10 (soft landing)
3. Lateral jumps x 8 (stick landing)
4. Small broad jumps x 5 (50% effort)
5. Broad jumps x 5 (max effort, stick landing)

## 24. Bench Press

**Equipment:** Machine only

**Why this works:** Bench press is horizontal pressing. The warmup activates the chest, shoulders, and triceps while building scapular stability.

| Round | Station 1 (Cardio) | Station 2 | Station 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | Jog 200m | Scapular push-ups x 10 | Push-ups x 8 |
| Round 2 | Inchworm walk x 6 | Hand-release push-ups x 6 | Dead bug x 8 (alt) |
| Round 3 | Bear crawl 20m + walk back | Push-ups x 10 (fast) | Plank hold 20s |

**Coach's Cues:**
- Scapular push-ups: "In plank, let shoulder blades come together, then push apart. No elbow bend"
- Hand-release: "Full chest down, hands off floor, press up. Full ROM"

**Post-Warmup Mobility (60-90s):**
- Doorway chest stretch x 30s/side (elbow at 90°)
- Banded shoulder distraction x 30s/side
- Thoracic extension on foam roller x 30s

**Movement Prep (with empty barbell):**
1. Bench press x 10 @ empty bar (establish arch, tight setup)
2. Pause bench press (2s at chest) x 5 @ empty bar
3. Bench press x 5 @ 40%
4. Bench press x 3 @ 60%
5. Build to working weight in doubles or singles

## Pre-Workout Quality Check

Before starting the main work, athletes should:

✓ **Feel warm** - light sweat, elevated breathing
✓ **Feel mobile** - joints move freely through required ROM
✓ **Feel activated** - muscles engaged, not fatigued
✓ **Feel confident** - movement patterns feel smooth

**Red flags (don't proceed):**
- Sharp joint pain
- Muscle tightness that won't release
- Dizziness or excessive fatigue
- Movement feels "off" or restricted
