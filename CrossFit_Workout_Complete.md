# CrossFit Workout: Front Squat Strength + Barbell Complex

**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Duration:** 60-75 minutes
**Equipment:** Barbells, plates, resistance band (mini-band), foam roller

---

## WARM-UP (10-12 minutes)

**Protocol:** RAMP (Raise-Activate-Mobilize-Potentiate)
**Goal:** Increase core temperature, activate key muscle groups, mobilize joints, potentiate the nervous system for heavy squatting and Olympic lifts.

---

### PHASE 1: RAISE (3 minutes)

**Purpose:** Increase heart rate, core/muscle temperature, and blood flow (research shows 1-2°C muscle temp increase enhances performance)

**Easy Aerobic:**
- Row, bike, ski, or jog: 2-3 minutes at conversational pace
- Jump rope or high knees: 1 minute (slightly elevated pace)
- Target: light sweat, HR ~120-140 bpm

**Research Note:** Gradual temperature increase enhances muscle elasticity and nerve conduction velocity without inducing fatigue.

---

### PHASE 2: ACTIVATE (3 minutes)

**Purpose:** Target glutes, core, and scapular stabilizers—critical for squatting mechanics and overhead stability

**2 Rounds:**

1. **Glute Bridge March** (10 reps per side)
   - Hold bridge, march one leg at a time, maintain level hips
   - Cue: squeeze glutes hard throughout

2. **Banded Lateral Walks** (10 steps each direction)
   - Mini-band around knees, quarter squat position
   - Activates gluteus medius for knee stability

3. **Dead Bug (Contralateral)** (8 reps per side)
   - Slow, controlled; maintain lower back contact with floor
   - Core anti-extension for bracing during squats

**Research Note:** Glute activation drills improve squat depth and reduce compensatory knee valgus (inward collapse). Core activation enhances intra-abdominal pressure for safer heavy lifts.

---

### PHASE 3: MOBILIZE (3 minutes)

**Purpose:** Dynamic ROM for ankles, hips, thoracic spine—all critical for upright front squat positioning

**2 Rounds:**

1. **World's Greatest Stretch** (5 reps per side)
   - Lunge → elbow to instep → rotation → reach overhead
   - Targets hip flexors, adductors, T-spine rotation

2. **Cossack Squats** (6 reps alternating)
   - Wide stance, shift side to side, keep heels down
   - Improves ankle dorsiflexion and adductor length

3. **Thoracic Bridge (Reach-Through)** (8 reps per side)
   - Quadruped, thread arm under body, then reach to sky with rotation
   - Enhances T-spine rotation needed for upright torso

**Research Note:** Dynamic stretching pre-workout improves ROM without decreasing force production (unlike static stretching). Focus on movement quality over speed.

---

### PHASE 4: POTENTIATE (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose:** Activate fast-twitch fibers and prepare movement patterns at higher velocities (Post-Activation Potentiation)

**Perform once through with intent:**

1. **Squat Jumps** (5 reps)
   - Quarter squat, explosive jump, soft landing
   - Arms swing overhead (mimics receiving position)

2. **Speed Air Squats** (10 reps)
   - Full depth, fast descent, explosive up
   - Cue: "fast down, faster up"

3. **Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (Bodyweight)** (5 per side)
   - Slow eccentric, balance challenge
   - Primes hip hinge and proprioception for cleans

**Research Note:** Low-volume, high-intensity movements (like jumps) create PAP effect—temporary enhancement of force production for 3-10 minutes post-stimulus. Ideal before heavy strength work.

---

**Coach's Note on Warm-up:** This RAMP sequence is evidence-based and time-efficient. Don't skip phases—each serves a specific physiological purpose. Athletes should feel "switched on" but not fatigued. If someone struggles with a movement (e.g., cossack squats), scale ROM rather than skip.

---

## TARGETED MOBILITY (Optional: 2-3 minutes)

**Only if individual athletes need additional work after RAMP. Most will be ready to proceed to empty bar.**

Pick 1-2 areas:

1. **Ankle Dorsiflexion Wall Stretch** (30 seconds per side)
   - If athletes struggled with cossack squats or bottom position

2. **Banded Front Rack Distraction** (30 seconds per arm)
   - If wrist/lat tightness limits front rack

**Coach's Note:** RAMP Phase 3 already addresses primary mobility needs. Only use this section for athletes with specific limitations.

---

## EMPTY BAR / EXERCISE-SPECIFIC PREP (5-8 minutes)

**Goal:** Introduce the bar only after mobility. Keep loads light and reps crisp.

### Empty Bar Flow (2 rounds, unbroken)

- 5 Deadlift (pause 1 second at knee on rep 1)
- 5 Hang Muscle Clean (fast elbows)
- 5 Front Squat (2-second pause on rep 1)
- 5 Push Press
- 3 Push Jerk (or strict press if learning)

**Coach's Notes (Empty Bar):**

- Cue "bar close" on cleans and "elbows up" on squats.
- This should look sharp and controlled—not rushed.

### A) Front Squat Progression

Perform with empty barbell, then progressively load:

1. **10 Reps: Pause Squats** (3-second pause at bottom) — Empty Bar
   - Focus on upright torso, elbows high

2. **5 Reps: Full-Speed Squats** (normal tempo) — Empty Bar
   - Build confidence in movement

3. **3 Reps @ 50%** (estimated working weight)

4. **2 Reps @ 60%**

5. **1 Rep @ 67%** (warm-up to working weight)

**Coach's Note:** Each rep is a practice rep. Squeeze glutes, maintain tension, and fight to keep the elbows high. If elbows drop, the torso leans forward, and the lift becomes a back squat. Patience here prevents technical breakdown during heavy sets.

---

### B) Barbell Complex Prep

Perform the entire complex with empty barbell once, then at 40% estimated load:

- 5 Deadlifts
- 4 Hang Cleans
- 3 Front Squats
- 2 Push Press
- 1 Jerk

**Coach's Note:** This is about movement quality and establishing a strong setup. Athletes should feel where the bar needs to be positioned and understand the flow. Feedback cues: "move the bar in a straight line," "minimal movement in the middle," "speed under the bar on the clean."

---

## A) STRENGTH: FRONT SQUAT

**Every 2 Minutes for 7 Sets**

- **Sets 1-3:** 8 Reps @ 67%
- **Set 4:** 5 Reps @ 72%
- **Sets 5-6:** 2 Reps @ 77%
- **Set 7:** 1 Rep @ 82%

**Coach's Notes:**

- **"Fight for the elbows."** As loads increase and fatigue accumulates, athletes will naturally want to pitch forward. The elbows are the tell-tale sign. High elbows = upright torso = safe, efficient squat.
- **"Chest up, elbows up."** This is your primary cue. Use it on every rep, especially in the later sets when fatigue appears.
- **Movement quality over load:** If an athlete's elbows collapse, drop them back 5%, reset, and continue. Grinding a bad rep teaches bad movement.
- **Breathing:** Coach athletes to take a breath at the top, brace in the hole, then exhale powerfully on the drive up.
- **Recovery:** Full 2-minute rest between sets. Use this time to hydrate, analyze movement, and prepare mentally for the next set.

---

## B) CONDITIONING: BARBELL COMPLEX

**Every 2 Minutes for 7 Sets**

**Complex (Unbroken, in this order):**
1. 5 Deadlifts (60/35kg)
2. 4 Hang Cleans
3. 3 Front Squats
4. 2 Push Press
5. 1 Jerk

**Strategy & Rules:**

- This is a technical **"sprint"**—intensity is high, but the movement must be sound.
- The entire complex must be performed **unbroken**. If an athlete drops the bar at any point, they **restart the entire set.**
- Minimal transitions between movements.
- Rest the remainder of the 2-minute window after completing the complex.

**Coach's Notes:**

- **Flow and positioning:** The beauty of this complex is that each movement sets up the next. Deadlift → elbows under for hang clean → front rack stable for squat → overhead position carries into press → Jerk. Maintain bar proximity throughout.
- **Deadlifts:** Aggressive hip extension, neutral spine. This is your power engine for the entire complex.
- **Hang Cleans:** Explosive pull, fast elbows, receive in a quarter squat. Athletes often get lazy here after a deadlift—cue "quick feet, quick elbows."
- **Front Squats:** Use the momentum from the clean, but control the descent. Elbows stay high.
- **Push Press:** Dip is small and explosive. The dip-drive should feed directly into the press.
- **Jerk:** For lighter loads, a push jerk is acceptable. Athletes should receive in a partial squat, not standing. Stable overhead position before walking out.
- **Drop rule:** If the bar drops, reset mentally and physically, then restart from the deadlifts. This is part of the training stimulus—building resilience and focus.
- **Pacing:** Sets 1-3 should feel manageable. Sets 4-5 will feel harder. Sets 6-7 are all mental. Remind athletes: "You've done harder things."

## COOLDOWN & STRETCHING (8-10 minutes)

**Goal:** Downshift the nervous system, restore front rack/overhead tissues, and open hips/quads/ankles after squatting.

### 1) Downshift (1-2 minutes)

- **Easy walk or bike** (60-90 seconds)
- **Box Breathing** for 4-6 cycles: 4 seconds in / 4 hold / 4 out / 4 hold

### 2) Optional Soft Tissue (2-3 minutes total)

Pick 2 areas, 45-60 seconds each:

- **Quads**
- **Adductors** (inner thigh)
- **Lats** (helps front rack + overhead)
- **Upper back (T-spine)**

### 3) Static Stretch Flow (5-7 minutes)

1. **Couch Stretch** (60 seconds per side)
   - Squeeze glute on the down leg; ribs stacked
   - Best post-squat hip flexor/quads reset

2. **Front Rack / Wrist Stretch** (45-60 seconds)
   - Prayer stretch + reverse prayer, then gentle fingertip rock-backs
   - Keep sensation in forearm/wrist, not sharp pain

3. **Lat + Triceps Stretch on Rig/Wall** (60 seconds per side)
   - Hips back, ribs down; breathe into the side body

4. **90/90 Breathing Stretch** (60 seconds per side)
   - Tall spine, slow exhales; targets hips without cranking the knee

5. **Calf Stretch (Wall or Rig)** (45 seconds per side)
   - Heel heavy; knee tracks over toes (don't collapse arch)

6. **Thoracic Extension (Foam Roller or Child's Pose)** (60 seconds)
   - Long exhale to let the upper back soften

---

## COOLDOWN COACH'S NOTES

- **Breathing:** This is where you "turn the volume down." Prioritize long exhales (e.g., 4 seconds in, 6-8 out) to bring heart rate down and shift into recovery.

- **No forcing:** Post-barbell tissues (wrists, lats, hip flexors) respond best to steady, gentle holds. Athletes should feel mild discomfort, not sharp pain or numbness/tingling.

- **Front rack priority:** If athletes struggled to keep elbows up today, spend extra time on lats + wrists + T-spine. Better front rack mobility = safer squats and cleaner reps in future sessions.

- **Hydration & nutrition:** Hydrate right away; aim for a protein + carb meal within 1-2 hours.

- **Soreness is normal:** After a heavy squat day, DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) is expected. Encourage mobility and light activity the next day rather than complete rest.

## OVERALL COACHING PHILOSOPHY FOR THIS SESSION

1. **Warm-up flow:** RAMP protocol ensures proper physiological preparation without fatigue. Each phase serves a distinct purpose backed by exercise science.

2. **Strength block:** Builds technical capacity and neurological adaptation. Emphasis on movement quality over load.

3. **Conditioning block:** Combines power, speed, and endurance under fatigue. Technical "sprint" mentality maintains movement integrity.

4. **Cooldown transition:** Gradual shift from sympathetic arousal back to parasympathetic calm. Promotes recovery and injury prevention.

**Key Theme:** "Earn the heavy weights through technical excellence. Move well, move fast, then recover hard."
