# CrossFit Workout Programming Agent Guidelines

**Last Updated:** 18 stycznia 2026
**Purpose:** Document rules and principles for creating CrossFit workouts, warmups, and cooldowns.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Evidence-Based Foundation:**
- RAMP method (Raise, Activate, Mobilize, Potentiate) by Ian Jeffreys
- PAP/PAPE timing principles (3-7 min rest after heavy loads)
- Dynamic movement prep over static stretching pre-workout
- Separate chronic mobility from heavy lifting

**Priorities:** Safety, time efficiency, athlete engagement, measurable progress

---

## WARMUP PROTOCOLS (8-12 min)

**3 Rounds, 3 Stations:**
- **R1 RAISE:** Cardio 2:00 easy, basic movement, mobility (6-10 reps)
- **R2 ACTIVATE:** Cardio 1:30 moderate, activation (8-12), dynamic ROM (8-10)
- **R3 POTENTIATE:** Cardio 1:00 hard, explosive drill (5-8), movement primer
- Rest 30-60s between rounds

**Equipment:** Max 1 extra item beyond cardio. Stage all before starting.
**Cardio:** Row, bike, ski, run, rope, shuttle runs. Subs: jumping jacks, high knees, mountain climbers (2x time).

---

## POST-WARMUP MOBILITY (60-90s)

30-45s per position/side, 2-3 positions max, movement-specific. NOT long static holds.

**Common:** Front rack/lat stretch on rig, couch stretch, pike hamstring, T-spine extension, deep squat hold.

---

## MOVEMENT PREP (3-5 min)

**Placement:** After strength/skill work, BEFORE main conditioning piece (gives athletes fresh reps + mental reset).

Empty bar/light implement, 3-6 reps per drill, progressive complexity.

**Barbell:** DL x5 → Hang Power Clean x5 → Front Squat x5 → Push Press x5 → Jerk x3 → Full x2
**Gymnastic:** Scap pulls x10 → Kip swings x10 → Jumping pulls x5 → Wall taps x20 → HSW practice

---

## COOLDOWN (2-4 min)

1. Easy cyclical (bike/row/jog), nasal breathing, RPE 2-3/10
2. Mobility 2-3 positions (1-2 min): Lower body (pigeon, couch, child's pose), Upper body (puppy, thread needle, forearm), Mixed (legs up wall, cat-cow, figure-4)

---

## SCALING & REGRESSIONS

Pick one option, keep consistent. Use RPE 7-8 if no 1RM. Offer 2-3 tiers.

**Priority Hierarchy:** Load → Volume → Movement Complexity

**Load Scaling First:** Reduce weight/load to preserve movement pattern and stimulus.
- ✓ Front squat 75 lbs (heavy, same movement)
- ✗ Air squat (easy, different stimulus)
- ✓ Banded strict pull-ups (hard, same pattern)
- ✗ Kipping pull-ups (easier, different stimulus)

**Prefer strict/harder movement at lighter load over easier technical variant.**

**Lifts:** Clean (hang power → muscle → pulls), Snatch (power → muscle → pulls), Jerk (push jerk → press)
**Gymnastics:** Pulls (Strict → Banded strict → Rows), BMU/RMU (Strict → Banded → Rows+Dips), HSW (Wall walk → Wall taps → Bear crawl), T2B (Strict → Banded → Knee raises)
**Other:** Front rack (Barbell → Cross-arm → DB), Devil press (Heavy DB → Light DB → Burpee+press), Wall balls (Heavy → Light → DB thruster), Box step-overs (Full height → Step-up → Reduce load)

---

## STRENGTH PROGRAMMING

**Front Squat Cycles:** Every 2:00 x 7 sets, progressive volume drop with intensity increase
- Week 4: 8-8-8@67%, 5@72%, 2-2@77%, 1@82%
- Week 5: 3-3-3@70%, 5@75%, 2-2@80%, 1@85%

**1RM Testing:** Tc 8-10 min, build from empty/50% in 3-5 jumps, prefer "heavy technical single" for complexes.

---

## CONDITIONING

**EMOM:** Single 6-10 min, Multi-station 15-25 min, Couplet/triplet 12-18 min
**AMRAP:** Solo 12-18 min, Team of 2: 12-24 min, Team of 3: 15-30 min. Always include Tc.
**For Time:** Short 5-8 min (high skill/intensity), Mid 10-15 min (mixed), Long 18-25 min (endurance). Always Tc.
**Intervals:** X min ON / Y min OFF, ratios 1:1, 2:1, 3:1. Use finish targets for pacing.

---

## LOGISTICS & SESSION FLOW

**Group Class Constraints:**
- **Single Start:** All athletes start together (no heats/staggered starts).
- **60-Minute Cap:** Every session fits hard 60:00 with explicit timing blocks.
- **Equipment:** Set up ONE lane before starting (all staged). If machines not adjacent, use bodyweight cardio.

**Session Timing:** Warmup 8-12 min, Mobility 60-90s, **Strength/Skill 10-20 min**, **Reset Window 3-5 min**, **Prep 2-4 min**, Conditioning 12-25 min, Cooldown 2-4 min. **Total: 60 min (group start).**

**Coach Cues:** External focus (action on object, not body), 1 idea at a time, under 10 words, action-focused, in quotes.
- Example ✓: "Push the floor apart." "Launch the bar up." "Kick toes to bar."
- Avoid ✗: "Widen stance" / "Keep elbows high" / "Squeeze shoulder blades."

---

## COACHING PLAYBOOK (For Group Classes)

**Whiteboard Brief (≤3:00):**
- Stimulus: 1 sentence (sprint vs grind; skill vs engine)
- Flow: lane layout + equipment + standards
- Scaling: A/B/C options (preserve stimulus, not intensity)
- Safety: top 1 risk + how to scale out

**Priorities (in order):** Safety → Function → Optimization

**Cueing Rules:**
- External cues only (object/environment focus, not body parts)
- 1 idea at a time
- Micro scan (1–3 reps), then macro scan (whole room)

**Scaling Rules (preserve stimulus):**
- Load: reduce to keep rep rhythm/speed
- Volume: reduce reps to hit time domain
- Complexity: swap to a similar pattern (strict before kipping; heavier before easier)
- **Avoid:** Scaling UP in difficulty (e.g., kipping when athlete should do strict)

**Debrief (2–4 min):**
1. Downshift breathing: 20-40s (nasal, parasympathetic)
2. "One bright spot": 60-90s (ask open, offer examples)
3. Score + stimulus check: 30-60s (what to change next time)
4. Tech takeaway: 20-40s (1 cue to remember)
5. Logistics: 10-20s (log scores, announcements)

**"One Bright Spot" Examples (give athletes options):**
- **Process:** "I scaled early and kept moving." "My transitions were faster."
- **Pacing:** "I held consistent splits." "I didn't redline in minute 1."
- **Technique:** "Elbows stayed high." "I kept ribs down overhead."
- **Gymnastics:** "I chose small sets and no misses."
- **Teamwork:** "Clear switch plan." "We communicated every round."
- **Mindset:** "Stayed calm when it got hard."

**Triage Scripts (say it, don't explain):**
- **Squat cave + heel lift** → "Push floor apart. Slow tempo."
- **Front rack pain** → "Cross-arm or DB front squat today."
- **Overhead instability** → "Push press / DB thruster / front squat."
- **Kip breaks under fatigue** → "Band / rows. Keep sets crisp."

## MOBILE-FRIENDLY FORMATTING

No tables. Use round-by-round lists with bullets. Short lines (max ~80 chars). Equipment as lists. Blank lines after headers. Short coach cue sentences.
Include brief descriptions for less common movements and target areas for mobility (e.g., 'Pigeon (deep glute): 45s/side').

**Structure per Day:**
- Setup (Equipment, Timing, Stimulus, Standards, Scaling A/B/C, Top Cues, Bottleneck fix)
- Warmup (RAMP: R1/R2/R3)
- Mobility
- Strength/Skill Work
- Reset Window (if applicable)
- Prep (movement-specific primers)
- Main Conditioning
- Cooldown + Debrief

---

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

**Research:** See [PAP/PAPE research and protocols](PAP_PAPE_Research.md)
**Coaching:** See [Coach_Quickguide.md](Coach_Quickguide.md) and [The_Science_and_Art_of_HIFT.md](The_Science_and_Art_of_HIFT.md)
**Programming:** Athlete tiers for auto-scaling, RPE tracking, video drill library
**Documentation:** Session templates, equipment sub matrix, scaling flowchart
**Tech:** Auto-timer tool, load calculator, demo video library

---

## COACH CHECKLIST

**Pre-session:** Equipment staged, machines functional/subs ready, whiteboard populated, percentages calculated
**Warmup:** All 3 rounds complete, light sweat, no fatigue, movement prep done, ROM checked
**Workout:** Tc announced, scaling explained, standards clarified, start protocol clear
**Cooldown:** Full cooldown complete, log notes, address technique issues

---

## EVIDENCE BASE

1. Warmup 5-10 min achieves 1-2°C temp increase (optimal)
2. Dynamic > static pre-workout (avoid 5-8% strength deficit)
3. PAP timing 3-7 min rest after heavy loads
4. Chronic stretching: small flexibility gains when separate
5. Progressive intensity R1→R2→R3 enhances force production

## AI AGENT GUIDELINES

When generating workouts, warmups, or cooldowns:

1. RAMP structure (3 rounds, progressive intensity)
2. Equipment list at top (bullet format)
3. Scaling options for technical movements (A/B/C preserve stimulus)
4. Time caps for all timed pieces
5. **External cues only** (action on object, not body parts)
6. Mobile format (no tables, short lines ~80 chars, bullets)
7. Post-warmup mobility 60-90s
8. **Prep after strength/skill, before main conditioning (fresh reps)**
9. Reset windows for group synchronization (3-5 min between parts)
10. Cooldown 2-4 min + 2-3 stretches + debrief prompts
11. Equipment staging noted + bottleneck fixes
12. **Single group start (all athletes start together)**
13. **Hard 60-minute cap with explicit timing blocks**
14. Debrief structure: breathing → bright spot → score check → takeaway → logistics
